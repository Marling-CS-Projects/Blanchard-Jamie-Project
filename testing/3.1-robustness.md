# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

As my development has been halted, now is a good time to test the function and robustness. 2 criteria fit the category of function and robustness.

| Criterion | Description                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 43        | The game must not crash                 |
| 44        | The game should run a minimum of 60 fps |

### Criterion 43

To ensure the game doesn't crash, I tried to use unusual inputs to see if there was a scenario the code wasn't ready for. The game didn't crash, so it fits this criteria

### Criterion 44

To test the FPS, I used my fps code from cycle 11 to give me the FPS, I then passed that value into game and used my numbers to display it
