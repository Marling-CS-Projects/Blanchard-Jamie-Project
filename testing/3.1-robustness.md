# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

As my development has been halted, I can now test the function and robustness. 2 criteria fit the category of function and robustness.

| Criterion | Description                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 44        | The game must not crash                 |
| 45        | The game should run a minimum of 60 fps |

### Criterion 44

To ensure the game doesn't crash, I tried to use unusual inputs to see if there was a scenario the code wasn't ready for. The game didn't crash, so it fits this criteria

### Criterion 45

To test the FPS, I used my fps code from cycle 11 to give me the FPS, I then passed that value into game and used my numbers to display it

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The game displaying 59 fps</p></figcaption></figure>

It says 59 instead of 60, but if I increase the frame loop the game can run much faster, showing it's not limited to 59. I think it's an error with my frames per second code as the game seems to run at 60fps
