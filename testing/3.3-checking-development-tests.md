| 2    | Press the jump and fastfall key         | Fall speed should be doubled when the fastfall key is pressed. This stays until you double jump or touch the ground                                    | What I expected                                                                                                                         |
| 3    | Moving left and right in ground and air | Ground and air speed should be different speeds, while coming to a stop after pressing no keys and increasing in speed slowly until reaching max speed | What I expected, apart from the fact that I forgot to implement ground and aerial speed                                                 |
| 4    | Interacting with the stage              | You should lose fall speed on the stage if you land on it from ontop                                                                                   | If you collide with the stage, even if from the side or below, you're put ontop of the stage. This is an issue from the side or bottom. |
