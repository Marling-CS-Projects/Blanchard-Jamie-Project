# 3.3 Checking Development Tests

A complete set of tests should be run to assess the final solution.

They could be plucked from the tests in your dev cycles, or be new tests that run the system as a whole.

## Cycle 1

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect                       | What actually happens        | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code     | The assets to display on the screen | Assets appearing as expected | Pass      |

## Cycle 2

| Test | Instructions                            | What I expect to happen                                                                                                                                | What actually happens                                                                                                                   |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Press nothing                           | The characters will fall to the stage and then stop falling                                                                                            | What I expected                                                                                                                         |
| 2    | Press the jump and fastfall key         | Fall speed should be doubled when the fastfall key is pressed. This stays until you double jump or touch the ground                                    | What I expected                                                                                                                         |
| 3    | Moving left and right in ground and air | Ground and air speed should be different speeds, while coming to a stop after pressing no keys and increasing in speed slowly until reaching max speed | What I expected, apart from the fact that I forgot to implement ground and aerial speed                                                 |
| 4    | Interacting with the stage              | You should lose fall speed on the stage if you land on it from ontop                                                                                   | If you collide with the stage, even if from the side or below, you're put ontop of the stage. This is an issue from the side or bottom. |

## Cycle 4

| Test | Instructions                             | What I expect                                                                                                                               | What actually happens                                                  |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Test stage collision from previous cycle | To collide with the stage                                                                                                                   | I could go through the bottom of the stage                             |
| 2    | Test move collision                      | Moves colliding with characters should deal knockback                                                                                       | What I expected                                                        |
| 3    | Test knockback                           | Players will be knocked further back each death until they die                                                                              | What I expected                                                        |
| 4    | Test lives                               | When falling off the stage, a player should lose a life and respawn                                                                         | What I expected                                                        |
| 5    | Test lag                                 | A player should be unable to move for start up, active frames and end lag. On top of this moves should only activate after the start up lag | Only the player experiences the startup lag, the move starts instantly |

## Cycle 5

| Test | Instructions                                         | What I expect                                                              | What actually happens                                                                                                                | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| 1    | Test stage collision                                 | Characters should be unable to collide with the stage                      | As expected                                                                                                                          | Pass      |
| 2    | Test disjointed moves and                            | Moves should be separate from the player if enabled                        | As expected, but I coincidentally found that if a character is facing left and goes past the right boundary of the screen it crashes | Fail      |
| 3    | Test character rotation by checking hitboxes and     | The character sprite should be able to rotate and moves rotating with it   | As expected                                                                                                                          | Pass      |
| 4    | Check how much scalar knockback increases by per hit | If it increases too much, it shows that the move is hitting multiple times | As expected                                                                                                                          | Pass      |
