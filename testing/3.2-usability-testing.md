# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Are the rules of the game easy to infer?                                                  |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the controls easy to understand? Is the menu easy to navigate?                        |
| 3 - Engaging       | Are the characters unique and fun to control? Is the player vs player aspect interesting? |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Are there any bugs? Does the game run at a good framerate without crashing?               |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Does the controls menu explain the controls well? Are the controls easy to use?           |

Listed below are the results of the [questions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jMLAYh6TSQSLULqdCOt8r67Vs1lns-aoPoWndydsiGI/edit?usp=forms\_home\&ths=true). I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

## User Feedback

I decided to get feedback from my friends and family to get a wide spread of opinions and feedback

### Effective

People said that it was pretty easy to work out the objective of the game, which is good as I didn't have to explain the game with loads of menus for people to understand it

### Efficient

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)

Most people said the game's controls were easy to understand, but I understand the one comment saying it wasn't as there are 9 controls per player.&#x20;

The request to make the controls more intuitive is interesting because they didn't suggest a solution that would make them more intuitive. However, I'm pretty sure this person doesn't play platformers or fighting games often so the controls can feel overwhelming.

### Engaging





### Error Tolerant





### Easy to learn

This means all players could tell where they could stand, despite the changes to the FillRect() function

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 43        | The game should meet the PEGI 7 requirements  |
| 42        | The AI should be challenging enough to beat   |
| 39        | Characters should have unique moves and stats |

### Criterion 43

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png>)

As there was no inappropriate content, it fits the PEGI 7 rating

### Criterion 42

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png>)

As 1 was easy and 5 was hard, the AI was hard enough for players

### Criterion 39

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png>)

Most people felt that characters were pretty unique, even if the faster characters were better
