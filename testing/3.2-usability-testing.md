# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Are the rules of the game easy to infer?                                                  |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the controls easy to understand? Is the menu easy to navigate?                        |
| 3 - Engaging       | Are the characters unique and fun to control? Is the player vs player aspect interesting? |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Are there any bugs? Does the game run at a good framerate without crashing?               |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Does the controls menu explain the controls well? Are the controls easy to use?           |

## User Feedback

I decided to get feedback from my friends and family to get a wide spread of opinions and feedback. I accomplished this by sending them my game and giving them a [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jMLAYh6TSQSLULqdCOt8r67Vs1lns-aoPoWndydsiGI/edit). However, most played the game for \~5 minutes, which I feel doesn't provide a good overview of the game as it's meant to be taken as a competitive game that can be replayed many times. This meant users didn't look at advanced options like dashing or fast falling and had little time to work out the differences between moves.

### Effective

People said that it was mostly easy to work out the objective of the game. This is surprising as I provided little information to inform the users about gameplay (as I didn't include a how to play section). Users were meant to work out how to play themselves by experimenting over time, and as people played for \~5 minutes, I thought most would struggle to work out the objective. The fact that people worked out the objective with little time investment and no explanation means it must be intuitive.

### Efficient

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The controls were very hard to make as I had to fit 18 controls on one keyboard such that 2 players could play. This means 75% of players being happy with the controls is very good.&#x20;

Most of the requests suggest general changes without providing a solution for what to change them to. Without an obvious solution to use, I can't switch them to anything.&#x20;

The request to make them closer together has potential. I can't make the left side any closer without using R as special (which wouldn't work as if your index finger is on F and middle finger is on T and G then you can't use your thumb, index finger or little finger to press R and you can't comfortably use your index finger). However, I could try rebinding dodge to LShift/M which would reduce the chance of player 1's little finger colliding with player 2's little finger, but this is less comfortable than LShift/N so puts player 2 at a disadvantage. I could also try Q/RShift which theoretically stops player 2's little finger from being close to H, but in practical tests, player 2's little finger still naturally rests on N. This also makes the input for dodging left awkward for both players 1 and 2. This is fixed by using (R or Y)/(I or P), but as player 2's little finger still rests on N, this doesn't accomplish anything.

### Engaging

This shows me that people think the faster characters are more powerful, so I can either nerf their damage and stun or buff the slower characters. The responses at least give me an idea of who is more powerful.&#x20;

During my testing, I noticed you could combo circle's down air into itself, eventually into a forward air to take a life away from the opponent after hitting them at 0%.

On top of this, I found it was hard to take an opponent's life with the damage being capped at 99% (unlike similar games like Smash Bros. Ultimate and Rivals of Aether) so I should have decreased the weight stat of all characters by 0.1 or more.

69% of players prefer multiplayer, which shows that people prefer the intended method of playing the game. This means the aspects tailored to multiplayer have a greater impact on users.

### Error Tolerant

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Users claiming the game barely lagged means it probably stayed at the intended 60fps. I asked people who replied with 2 if the game lagged and they claimed it didn't. I think they might have thought that hit stun was the game lagging.

The only time the game crashed was in cycle 5's testing, if a character is facing left and goes past the right boundary of the screen.

This only happens in fullscreen and could easily be fixed in future development.

### Easy to learn

I talked about the game's simplicity in [Effective ](3.2-usability-testing.md#effective)and [Efficient](3.2-usability-testing.md#efficient), which had generally good responses.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 39        | Characters should have unique moves and stats |
| 42        | The AI should be challenging enough to beat   |
| 43        | The game should meet the PEGI 7 requirements  |

### Criterion 39

I talked about this in [Engaging](3.2-usability-testing.md#engaging) where I received generally positive comments, but some suggestions to change the balance.

### Criterion 42

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The AI seemed to be hard enough to provide a challenge for most players, while not being too hard. Truthfully it's not as hard to beat as I would have liked, but it's still entertaining to play against.

### Criterion 43

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (46).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Despite the idea of it being a fight between 2 players, users claimed there was no inappropriate content. This means it should obtain a PEGI 7 rating.
