# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Are the rules of the game easy to infer?                                                  |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the controls easy to understand? Is the menu easy to navigate?                        |
| 3 - Engaging       | Are the characters unique and fun to control? Is the player vs player aspect interesting? |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Are there any bugs? Does the game run at a good framerate without crashing?               |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Does the controls menu explain the controls well? Are the controls easy to use?           |

## User Feedback

I decided to get feedback from my friends and family to get a wide spread of opinions and feedback. I accomplished this by sending them my game and giving them a [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jMLAYh6TSQSLULqdCOt8r67Vs1lns-aoPoWndydsiGI/edit). However, most played the game for \~5 minutes, which I feel doesn't provide a good overview of the game as it's meant to be taken as a competitive game that can be replayed many times. This meant users didn't look at advanced options like dashing or fast falling and had little time to work out the differences between moves.

### Effective

People said that it was mostly easy to work out the objective of the game. This is surprising as I provided little information to inform the users about gameplay (as I didn't include a how to play section). Users were meant to work out how to play themselves by experimenting over time, and as people played for \~5 minutes, I thought most would struggle to work out the objective. The fact that people worked out the objective with little time investment and no explanation means it must be intuitive.

### Efficient

Most people said the game's controls were easy to understand, but I understand the one comment saying it wasn't as there are 9 controls per player.&#x20;

START AGAIN HERE

The request to make the controls more intuitive is interesting because they didn't suggest a solution that would make them more intuitive. However, I'm pretty sure this person doesn't play platformers or fighting games often so the controls can feel overwhelming.

### Engaging





### Error Tolerant





### Easy to learn

This means all players could tell where they could stand, despite the changes to the FillRect() function

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 43        | The game should meet the PEGI 7 requirements  |
| 42        | The AI should be challenging enough to beat   |
| 39        | Characters should have unique moves and stats |

### Criterion 43

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png>)

As there was no inappropriate content, it fits the PEGI 7 rating

### Criterion 42

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1).png>)

As 1 was easy and 5 was hard, the AI was hard enough for players

### Criterion 39

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png>)

Most people felt that characters were pretty unique, even if the faster characters were better
