## Rules

<table><thead><tr><th width="80">Ref. No.</th><th width="245">Criterion</th><th width="234">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>There should be a choice of multiple stages. The player should infer that it has collision. Characters should be able to collide with it and wall jump on it</td><td>Having a stage as a central element allows for many strategical elements such as stage control and edge guarding as well as providing similar mechanics to a platformer</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#art-style">Art Style</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Players should be able to spawn on opposite sides of the stage</td><td>This allows both players to have equal stage control as well as having an equal starting position</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Players should be able to use moves which deal damage and knockback to their opponent</td><td>This is the core mechanic that allows players to win. Moves add the conflict between the players of having a way to harm the other</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#functionality-of-inputs">Functionality of Inputs</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Moves should have fixed knockback and scalar knockback</td><td>This allows some moves to combo at early and late percents, as well as allowing other moves to kill at later percents</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#functionality-of-inputs">Functionality of Inputs</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Scalar knockback should be represented by a value called percent that is displayed during the game</td><td>This allows a straightforward way to present knockback, as knockback is directly proportional to percent. This is also the method used in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Lives should be lost when a player reaches the boundary of the screen</td><td>This allows a way for the game to end and one player to win. This is an effective way to lose lives as it makes people use their movement options to get back to the stage</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Characters should respawn with temporary invincibility at the centre of the stage after death</td><td>This means the opponent isn't placed in a predictable position and hit as soon as they respawn</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Invincibility should be lost after using a move</td><td>This way the respawn invincibility can't be abused</td><td><p></p><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="1.3-research-the-problem.md#nickelodeon-all-star-brawl">Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>The game should end if one player runs out of lives</td><td>This allows a win condition for the players and a climactic finish</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>The game should end if the timer runs out</td><td>This means the game doesn't last longer than expected and both players can't stall until the other approaches</td><td><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>
