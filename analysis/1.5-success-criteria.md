| 1        | There should be a stage that the players can tell has collision and that characters can collide with / stand on | Having a stage as a central element allows for many strategical elements such as stage control and edge guarding as well as providing similar mechanics to a platformer | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#art-style">Art Style</a></li></ul> |
| 2        | Players should be able to spawn on opposite sides of the stage                                                  | This allows both players to have equal stage control as well as having an equal starting position                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 3        | Players should be able to use moves which deal damage and knockback to their opponent                           | This is the core mechanic that allows players to win. Moves add the conflict between the players of having a way to harm the other                                      |                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 4        | Moves should have fixed knockback and scalar knockback                                                          | This allows some moves to combo at early and late percents, as well as allowing other moves to kill at later percents                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 5        | Scalar knockback should be represented by a value called percent that is displayed during the game              | This allows an easy way to present knockback, as knockback is directly proportional to percent. This is also the method used in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate              |                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 6        | Lives should be lost when a player reaches the boundary of the screen                                           | This allows a way for the game to end and one player to win. This is a good way to lose lives as it makes people use their movement options to get back to the stage    |                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 7        | Characters should respawn with temporary invincibility at the centre of the stage after death                   | This means the opponent isn't placed in a predictable position and hit as soon as they respawn                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 8        | Invincibility should be lost after using a move                                                                 | This way the respawn invincibility can't be abused                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 9        | The game should end if one player runs out of lives                                                             | This allows a win condition for the players and a climactic finish                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 10       | The game should end if the timer runs out                                                                       | This means the game doesn't last longer than expected and both players can't stall until the other approaches                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                           |

| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| 11       | The characters should be able to move using a set control scheme that is different for each player | This allows players to not control both characters so each player has their own unique set of inputs                                       |           |
| 12       | WASD and ↑←↓→ should be used for directional inputs                                                | These are on opposite sides of the keyboard and are both traditionally used for direction                                                  |           |
| 13       | G and L should be used for jumping                                                                 | These are central keys the other keys can be placed around that can be pressed with your middle finger                                     |           |
| 14       | F and K should be used for light attacks                                                           | These are both positioned near jump and are easy keys to press with your ring or index finger                                              |           |
| 15       | T and O should be used for heavy attacks                                                           | These are both positioned near jump and (as they don't need to be pressed at the same time as jump) can be pressed with your middle finger |           |
| 16       | H and ; should be used for special attacks                                                         | These are both positioned near jump and are easy to press with your ring or index finger                                                   |           |
| 17       | Left Shift and N should be used to dodge                                                           | These are both where the pinkie finger on your left hand is placed naturally                                                               |           |
| 18       | Esc and Enter should be used to pause                                                              | These are both hard keys to press accidentally and having 2 of them means either player can pause                                          |           |
| 19       | Directional inputs should decide what direction moves should be used in                            | This allows an easy way to use moves in a direction                                                                                        |           |
| 20       | Left and right directional inputs should move the character                                        | There isn't any overlap created by using left and right for moving and direction                                                           |           |
| 21       | Downwards directional inputs should allow players to fall faster in the air                        | This allows more aerial mobility                                                                                                           |           |

| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 22       | Characters should have one mid-air jump and be able to jump on the platform                          | This creates more options while in the air whilst still making it a valuable resource                                   |           |
| 23       | Moves should do a set amount of damage / percent                                                     | This way games are consistent                                                                                           |           |
| 24       | Moves should have directional knockback                                                              | This allows for a way to knock players off the edge of the screen                                                       |           |
| 25       | Moves should have a set amount of stun                                                               | This means you can't get hit for hitting a move                                                                         |           |
| 26       | Moves should have starting lag and ending lag                                                        | This makes moves punishable to make missing moves worse for the player that missed, as well as making moves need timing |           |
| 27       | Moves should have a hitbox for a set duration                                                        | This way the hitbox is more leniant than a one frame window                                                             |           |
| 28       | Moves should have a set size                                                                         | This allows moves to be predictable so interactions make sense                                                          |           |
| 29       | Moves should have a position either stationary, tied to the player or moving                         | This allows moes to be predictable so interactions make sense                                                           |           |
| 30       | Light attacks, strong attacks, aerial attacks and special attacks should all be unique in properties | This creates more options for each player and makes games more unique                                                   |           |
| 31       | There should be a buffer system to delay player inputs                                               | This means you don't need to be frame perfect with your inputs                                                          |           |

| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 32       | Characters should have unique walk speed             | This differentiates the characters to allow people to have more unique playstyles |           |
| 33       | Characters should have unique aerial speed           | This differentiates the characters to allow people to have more unique playstyles |           |
| 34       | Characters should have unique jump height            | This differentiates the characters to allow people to have more unique playstyles |           |
| 35       | Characters should have unique weight                 | This differentiates the characters to allow people to have more unique playstyles |           |
| 36       | Characters should have unique fall speed             | This differentiates the characters to allow people to have more unique playstyles |           |
| 37       | The characters hitboxes should be obvious and unique | This differentiates the characters to allow people to have more unique playstyles |           |

| 38       | The stage should be visible easily                                                                       | This allows players to know where to position themselves       |           |
