| 1        | There should be a stage that the players can tell has collision and that characters can collide with / stand on | Having a stage as a central element allows for many strategical elements such as stage control and edge guarding as well as providing similar mechanics to a platformer | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#art-style">Art Style</a></li></ul> |
| 2        | Players should be able to spawn on opposite sides of the stage                                                  | This allows both players to have equal stage control as well as having an equal starting position                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 3        | Players should be able to use moves which deal damage and knockback to their opponent                           | This is the core mechanic that allows players to win. Moves add the conflict between the players of having a way to harm the other                                      |                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 4        | Moves should have fixed knockback and scalar knockback                                                          | This allows some moves to combo at early and late percents, as well as allowing other moves to kill at later percents                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 5        | Scalar knockback should be represented by a value called percent that is displayed during the game              | This allows an easy way to present knockback, as knockback is directly proportional to percent. This is also the method used in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate              |                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 6        | Lives should be lost when a player reaches the boundary of the screen                                           | This allows a way for the game to end and one player to win. This is a good way to lose lives as it makes people use their movement options to get back to the stage    |                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 7        | Characters should respawn with temporary invincibility at the centre of the stage after death                   | This means the opponent isn't placed in a predictable position and hit as soon as they respawn                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 8        | Invincibility should be lost after using a move                                                                 | This way the respawn invincibility can't be abused                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 9        | The game should end if one player runs out of lives                                                             | This allows a win condition for the players and a climactic finish                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 10       | The game should end if the timer runs out                                                                       | This means the game doesn't last longer than expected and both players can't stall until the other approaches                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 12       | WASD and ↑←↓→ should be used for directional inputs                                                | These are on opposite sides of the keyboard and are both traditionally used for direction            |           |

## Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.
