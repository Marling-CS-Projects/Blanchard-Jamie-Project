| 1        | There should be a stage that the players can tell has collision and that characters can collide with / stand on | Having a stage as a central element allows for many strategical elements such as stage control and edge guarding as well as providing similar mechanics to a platformer | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#art-style">Art Style</a></li></ul>                                      |
| 2        | Players should be able to spawn on opposite sides of the stage                                                  | This allows both players to have equal stage control as well as having an equal starting position                                                                       | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li></ul>                                                                                                                          |
| 3        | Players should be able to use moves which deal damage and knockback to their opponent                           | This is the core mechanic that allows players to win. Moves add the conflict between the players of having a way to harm the other                                      | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#functionality-of-inputs">Functionality of Inputs</a></li></ul> |
| 4        | Moves should have fixed knockback and scalar knockback                                                          | This allows some moves to combo at early and late percents, as well as allowing other moves to kill at later percents                                                   | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#functionality-of-inputs">Functionality of Inputs</a></li></ul>          |
| 5        | Scalar knockback should be represented by a value called percent that is displayed during the game              | This allows an easy way to present knockback, as knockback is directly proportional to percent. This is also the method used in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate              | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li></ul>                                                                                                                          |
| 6        | Lives should be lost when a player reaches the boundary of the screen                                           | This allows a way for the game to end and one player to win. This is a good way to lose lives as it makes people use their movement options to get back to the stage    | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li></ul>                                                                                                                          |
| 7        | Characters should respawn with temporary invincibility at the centre of the stage after death                   | This means the opponent isn't placed in a predictable position and hit as soon as they respawn                                                                          | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li></ul>                                                                                                                          |
| 8        | Invincibility should be lost after using a move                                                                 | This way the respawn invincibility can't be abused                                                                                                                      | <p></p><ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="1.3-research-the-problem.md#nickelodeon-all-star-brawl">Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl</a></li></ul>  |
| 9        | The game should end if one player runs out of lives                                                             | This allows a win condition for the players and a climactic finish                                                                                                      | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li></ul>                                                                                                                          |
| 10       | The game should end if the timer runs out                                                                       | This means the game doesn't last longer than expected and both players can't stall until the other approaches                                                           | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#rules">Rules</a></li></ul>                                                                                                                          |

| 11       | The characters should be able to move using a set control scheme that is different for each player | This allows players to not control both characters so each player has their own unique set of inputs                                       | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#player-inputs">Player Inputs</a></li></ul>                                                                                                                 |

| 20       | Left and right directional inputs should move the character                                        | There isn't any overlap created by using left and right for moving and direction                                                           | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#player-inputs">Player Inputs</a></li><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#functionality-of-inputs">Functionality of Inputs</a></li></ul> |
| 21       | Downwards directional inputs should allow players to fall faster in the air                        | This allows more aerial mobility                                                                                                           | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#player-inputs">Player Inputs</a></li><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#functionality-of-inputs">Functionality of Inputs</a></li></ul> |

| 22       | Characters should have one mid-air jump and be able to jump on the platform                          | This creates more options while in the air whilst still making it a valuable resource                                   | <ul><li><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#functionality-of-inputs">Functionality of Inputs</a></li></ul> |
