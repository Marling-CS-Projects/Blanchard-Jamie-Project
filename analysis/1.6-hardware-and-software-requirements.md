# 1.6 Hardware and Software Requirements

## Development Requirements

To develop this game, I need a c++ compiler such as Visual Studio and enough performance to run the game. Visual Studio 2022 is a good option due to features like IntelliSense and the debugger. I also need to run the file, which as it's an exe file means I need either windows, a windows VM or a compatibility layer like WINE.

| Software  | Hardware Required                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Package 1 | <ul><li>Proc</li><li>RAM</li><li>Disk Space</li></ul> |
