Current video game rate of usage and why

Video games have been shown to have health benefits as they provide the same effects as regular games. This has been shown to result in adults being more motivated, creative and spontaneous ([René T. Proyer](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-well-being-of-playful-adults:-Adult-subjective-Proyer/d62a0f9f0068004a9ccb3a4b851bde37eac4e6a5?p2df), 2013). This is due to playful people being able to see everyday situations in a more entertaining and intellectually stimulating way ([René T. Proyer](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-well-being-of-playful-adults%3A-Adult-subjective-Proyer/d62a0f9f0068004a9ccb3a4b851bde37eac4e6a5?p2df), 2013)

Video games have become more and more engaging since creation due to the general rules and feedback provided. At its core, a game is a series of interesting choices (Rollings & Morris 2000, p. 38). Games have specific rules that lead to a specific outcome that make them enticing, for example, rock paper scissors being a voluntary conflict with a ritualistic dance and a specific series of rules to govern our conflict. With games like rock paper scissors, the rules are easy to follow so easy to enjoy. This is shown in other physical games, like Knucklebones. Digital games are more powerful as they can recieve feedback from players 60 times a second with more complicated rules to create a more powerful feedback loop ([Sam Von Ehren](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/style/why-people-love-games.html), 2020).&#x20;

This is where platform fighters come in. With the feedback loop of a 2d fighter (due to generally needing frame perfect inputs), the realism of an actual fight (depending on which one you pick up, as this isn't true for something like brawlhalla but is for The Outfoxies), the precision and "flow" of a 2d platformer and the social conflict of rock paper scissors, it perfectly combines all the psychology of game development.
