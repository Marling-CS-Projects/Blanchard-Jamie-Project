# 1.1 Problem Identification

## Why a video game?

The popularity of video games has increased:

* 4 out of every 5 consumers played a video game in the 6 months to November 2020 [(Chojnacki, 2020)](../reference-list.md)
* Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, with people being forced to stay inside their homes, video games provided an option to maintain human contact and to fill time
* Nine in 10 players say they are spending as much or more time playing in 2022 as they did at the pandemic’s peak [(Entertainment Software Association, 2022)](../reference-list.md)

* Nintendo in the second quarter of 2020 achieved 5 times the profits they achieved in the second quarter in 2019 [(Epstein, 2020)](../reference-list.md)
* UK Video Game Spending has increased from £891m to £2,640m in the 10 years to 2022.

### The Benefits of Video Games

Video games have been shown to provide different benefits. Playing shooting games has improved the player's spacial skills, strategic games can improve problem solving and simple games can improve the mood of the player [(Bowen, 2014)](../reference-list.md). Video games also provide the player with flow [(Michailidis et al., 2019)](../reference-list.md). Flow is a state achieved by professional athletes. It provides concentration and motivation to complete the task.&#x20;

### The Appeal of Video Games

At its core, a game is a competition defined by a series of choices [(Rollings & Morris 2000, p. 38)](../reference-list.md). Games have rules that define the way they are played, for example, "rock paper scissors" is a ritualistic dance that leads to a quickly resolved voluntary conflict based on rules both players understand.

Video games have become more engaging as a result of user feedback, increasing profit from game sales and improvements in computing.&#x20;

Digital games are able to capture detailed user interactions, over 60 times a second, to provide a stronger feedback loop [(Sam Von Ehren, 2020)](../reference-list.md), while involving more complex rules. Games can be tailored to target:

* The difficulty of game - to provide an enjoyable challenge for players
* Length of desired gameplay (there may be a conflict between the player's and developer's objectives)
* Social sharing - games are designed in a way that make players want to share the game, so more people will play it
* Profit - the developer has to have a reason they are benefitted from consumers playing their game (usually a financial benefit)
* Human interactions, such as multiple consumers competing or collaborating

### Why a Platform Fighter?

A platform fighter is a combination of platforming games (where you must jump over objects to get to the end of a level) and fighting games (where you control a character that's participating in a fight against an opposing player(s) or a computer).

Platform fighters are a popular genre; nearly 3 years after its release, Nintendo revealed that Smash Ultimate has been played for 2.2 billion hours [(Nintendo of America, 2021)](../reference-list.md) and 24.8 million copies of Smash Ultimate had been sold [(Nintendo, 2021)](../reference-list.md). This means every player played an average of 89 hours over 3 years, showing how captivating the game was.

Effective platform fighters typically include:

* Graphical representation of a real fight (some games, like Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl, use a cartoon style)
* Responsive game play - Frame-perfect inputs can capture over 60 inputs per second
* Player conflict (human or computerised).

The requirement for a graphically intensive game, with responsive game play and multiple player options makes a platform fighter the ideal genre for my project.
