Why video games are good\
At its core, a game is a series of interesting choices (Rollings & Morris 2000, p. 38). Games have specific rules that lead to a specific outcome that make them enticing, for example, rock paper scissors being a voluntary conflict with a ritualistic dance and a specific series of rules to govern our conflict. With games like rock paper scissors, the rules are easy to follow so easy to enjoy. This is shown in other physical games, like Knucklebones. Digital games are more powerful as they can recieve feedback from players 60 times a second with more complicated rules to create a more powerful feedback loop ([Sam Von Ehren](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/style/why-people-love-games.html), 2020). \

Video games have been shown to have the same effects as regular games, which is good as adults who demonstrate more playful personality traits are more motivated, creative and spontaneous ([René T. Proyer](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-well-being-of-playful-adults:-Adult-subjective-Proyer/d62a0f9f0068004a9ccb3a4b851bde37eac4e6a5?p2df), 2013). This is due to playful people being able to see everyday situations in a more entertaining and intellectually stimulating way ([René T. Proyer](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-well-being-of-playful-adults%3A-Adult-subjective-Proyer/d62a0f9f0068004a9ccb3a4b851bde37eac4e6a5?p2df), 2013)\
