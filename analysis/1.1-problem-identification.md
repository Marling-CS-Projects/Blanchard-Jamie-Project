# 1.1 Problem Identification

Video games have been increasing in popularity slowly for years now 4 out of every 5 consumers in one survey have played a video game in the last 4 months (Chojnacki, 2020). Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and people being forced to stay inside their homes, people have taken to video games to keep in contact with people or for something to do. 2020 had a 20% increase in video game sales with companies like Nintendo getting 5 times the profits they normally achieve (Epstein, 2020).

Video games have been shown to have health benefits as they provide the same effects as regular games. This has been shown to result in adults being more motivated, creative and spontaneous ([René T. Proyer](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-well-being-of-playful-adults:-Adult-subjective-Proyer/d62a0f9f0068004a9ccb3a4b851bde37eac4e6a5?p2df), 2013) and to provide the benefits of flow which professional athletes achieve (Cowley et al., 2008). This is due to playful people being able to see everyday situations in a more entertaining and intellectually stimulating way ([René T. Proyer](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-well-being-of-playful-adults%3A-Adult-subjective-Proyer/d62a0f9f0068004a9ccb3a4b851bde37eac4e6a5?p2df), 2013).&#x20;

Video games have become more and more engaging since creation due to the general rules and feedback provided. At its core, a game is a series of interesting choices (Rollings & Morris 2000, p. 38). Games have specific rules that lead to a specific outcome that make them enticing, for example, rock paper scissors being a voluntary conflict with a ritualistic dance and a specific series of rules to govern our conflict. With games like rock paper scissors, the rules are easy to follow so easy to enjoy. This is shown in other physical games, like Knucklebones. Digital games are more powerful as they can recieve feedback from players 60 times a second with more complicated rules to create a more powerful feedback loop ([Sam Von Ehren](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/style/why-people-love-games.html), 2020).&#x20;

This is where platform fighters come in. With the feedback loop of a 2d fighter (due to generally needing frame perfect inputs), the realism of an actual fight (depending on which one you pick up, as this isn't true for something like brawlhalla but is for The Outfoxies), the precision and "flow" of a 2d platformer and the social conflict of rock paper scissors, it perfectly combines all the psychology of game development. This is shown best with Smash Ultimate, where nearly 3 years after its release, Nintendo revealed that Smash Ultimate has been played for 2.2 billion hours (Nintendo of America, 2021) and 24.77 million copies of Smash Ultimate had been sold (“IR Information : Sales Data - Top Selling Title Sales Units,” n.d.). This means every player has played an average of 89 hours in 3 years, showing how captivating the game is.
