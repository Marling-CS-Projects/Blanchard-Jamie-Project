# 1.1 Problem Identification

## Why a video game?

The popularity of video games has increased:

* 4 out of every 5 consumers have played a video game in the last 4 months [(Chojnacki, 2020)](../reference-list.md)
* Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and people being forced to stay inside their homes, people have taken to video games to keep in contact with people or for something to do.&#x20;
* Video games sales increased by 32% from 2019 to 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, before then increasing by 3% from 2020 to 2021 despite the pandemic ending [(Powell, 2022)](../reference-list.md)
* Nine in 10 players say they are spending as much or more time playing now as they did at the pandemic’s peak [(Entertainment Software Association, 2022)](../reference-list.md)
* Nintendo in the second quarter of 2020 achieved 5 times the profits they achieved in the second quarter in 2019 [(Epstein, 2020)](../reference-list.md).

### The Benefits of Video Games

Video games have been shown to have health benefits as they provide the same effects as regular games. This has been shown to result in adults being more motivated, creative and spontaneous [(René T. Proyer, 2013)](../reference-list.md) and to provide the benefits of flow which professional athletes achieve [(Cowley et al., 2008)](../reference-list.md). This is due to playful people being able to see everyday situations in a more entertaining and intellectually stimulating way [(René T. Proyer, 2013)](../reference-list.md).&#x20;

### The Appeal of Video Games

Video games have become more and more engaging since their creation due to the general rules and feedback provided (REWORK). At its core, a game is a series of interesting choices [(Rollings & Morris 2000, p. 38)](../reference-list.md). Games have specific rules that lead to a specific outcome that make them enticing, for example, "rock paper scissors" is a voluntary conflict with a ritualistic dance and a specific series of rules to govern our conflict. With games like rock paper scissors, the rules are easy to follow so easy to enjoy. This is shown in other physical games, like Knucklebones (ADD SOURCE). Digital games are more powerful as they can receive feedback from players 60 times a second with more complicated rules to create a more powerful feedback loop [(Sam Von Ehren, 2020)](../reference-list.md).&#x20;

### Why a Platform Fighter?

This is where platform fighters come in. With the feedback loop of a 2d fighter (due to generally needing frame-perfect inputs), the realism of an actual fight (depending on which one you pick up, as this isn't true for something like Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl but is for The Outfoxies), the precision and "flow" of a 2d platformer and the social conflict of rock paper scissors, it perfectly combines all the psychology of game development. This is shown best with Smash Ultimate, where nearly 3 years after its release, Nintendo revealed that Smash Ultimate has been played for 2.2 billion hours [(Nintendo of America, 2021)](../reference-list.md) and 24.77 million copies of Smash Ultimate had been sold [(Nintendo, 2021)](../reference-list.md). This means every player has played an average of 89 hours in 3 years, showing how captivating the game is.
