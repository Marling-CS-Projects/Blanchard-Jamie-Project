# 1.2 Stakeholders

I'm making a platform fighter because it combines a large number of the gaming industry's innovations into one genre. It can incorporate multiplayer (or single-player), responsive game play, easy access, mastery and other aspects like a story or progression. This is also a format popular with people who play platformers or fighting games.

## Reasons for playing video games

The above graph [(Dsouza, 2021)](../reference-list.md) demonstrates the most common reasons people in Britain claimed they play video games.&#x20;

The most common reason across all age groups is to relax and wind down. This is generally hard to achieve with platform fighters, due to the precision and intense nature of the game and the technical inputs required. Gameplay is more relaxed outside of competitive play.&#x20;

Platform fighter gameplay can be adjusted to fit the available time. A limited gameplay time can be applied using an in-game timer. Multiple matches can fill an extended period of time.

Platform fighters often include graphics, character abilities and super-powers that are a good escape from reality.

Platform fighters, due to their complex nature, challenge players to improve their performance.

An understanding of an opponent's gameplay helps achieve a win.

### Multiplayer

Platform fighters are designed to be played against opponents. Multi-player play allows human interaction within the game.

The importance of in-game communication was raised during the Covid-19 pandemic, when people were forced to isolate.

83% of gamers play online or with others [(Entertainment Software Association, 2022)](../reference-list.md) - this provides a large target audience for platform fighters. My game will have local multiplayer, but not online multiplayer as I want to keep it free to play and run. A Remote Desktop application, like Parsec, would enable online multi-player games. A single player mode will appeal to the 17% of players not using online gaming.

### Ease of Learning

Platform fighters are easy to pick up due to them having all the characteristics of platformers, which have simple controls, e.g.:

* Right (pointing the joystick right or pressing the right key)
* Jumps (pressing a button on the control pad/keyboard)

Players need to learn that light attacks are fast and do little damage, heavy attacks do more damage but are slower and special attacks are unique.

Aside from controls, you need to know that you want to damage your opponent to win. This allows anyone who understands platformers to be able to pick up a platform fighter.

### Replayability

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p><a href="../reference-list.md">(Nintendo of America, 2021)</a></p></figcaption></figure>

As 24.8 million copies of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate have been sold and a total of 19.5 billion games have been played [(Nintendo, 2021)](../reference-list.md), the average person who bought Smash Bros played 786 games, so these games need to avoid being repetitive to make users want to continue playing.&#x20;

This is accomplished by having similar replayability and complexity to chess. In both chess and platform fighters, every match plays out exactly the same if the same inputs are provided - both games are skill based rather than chance. Players are aware of the other's movements and every hit taken is either a trade or a blunder. This model worked for chess, despite existing since the 16th century [(Chess.com, 2023)](../reference-list.md#1.2). In the first 7 years of Chess.com operating, 1 billion games were played on the platform [(Chess.com, 2014)](../reference-list.md).

Unlike Chess, platform fighters provide fast-paced gameplay, often over a larger area of play. The rapid play provides players with regular dopamine hits. Players also have the physical feedback of mastering game input.

### PEGI Ratings

What is PEGI?

PEGI provides recommended minium age ratings for games.

Ratings are based on game content and suitability for the players.

A lower age rating is a benefit because it makes the game available to a larger audience. Developers should therefore avoid properties that would give your game a higher age rating if targeting the largest possible audience.

The best example of how to avoid having a high PEGI rating for a platform fighter is the Super Smash Bros series. The Super Smash Bros. series originally was rated PEGI 7 for its N64 release and was then assigned PEGI 3 for Smash Bros. Melee on the GameCube. However, with the release of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, it was changed to a PEGI 12 [(Pegi, 2023)](../reference-list.md) due to the realism of the graphics and the introduction of Solid Snake, who uses real weaponry in the form of rocket launchers and grenades. This tradition was kept into its sequels, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS, Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, with them involving more characters like Solid Snake (Bayonetta and Joker).

Examples of platform fighters with low PEGI ratings, all rated as PEGI 7, are:

* Brawlhalla: while having guns, has a cartoon style
* Rivals of Aether: has pixellated graphics and no direct weapons (outside of its consumer-made content through Steam Workshop)
* Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl: has a cartoon style.

I will target PEGI 7 content for my game, using a similar style of pixelated graphics to Rivals of Aether.

### Conclusion

The target demographic for my game includes:

* Players of multiplayer games
* Player of platformers
* Player who prefer replayability over story-driven games
