# 1.2 Stakeholders

I'm making a platform fighter as they combine a large amount of the gaming industry's innovations into one game. It can incorporate multiplayer, single player, fast feedback cycles, low time dedication, mastery and if necesarry other aspects like a story or progression through other side elements, but I plan to follow the design of Rivals of Aether, with no story progression.\
\
Gamers' needs and how to appeal to them:\
Multiplayer\
Free to play\
Free to play games are becoming more popular in the industry, \
Easy to pick up\
Small time investment\
\
Same ESRB rating as the Smash Bros series, E for everyone for 64, Teen for Melee and Brawl and E 10+ for Smash 4 and Ultimate (“Ratings,” n.d.). As the most recent entry in the smash bros series is E 10+, that feels the most suitable. As it's one of the lowest ratings the Smash series has recieved (so has the largest target audience as people of the most ages can play it), it shares a rating with Nickelodeon: All Star Brawl, Rivals of Aether
