# 1.2 Stakeholders

I'm making a platform fighter as they combine a large amount of the gaming industry's innovations into one game. It can incorporate multiplayer, single player, fast feedback cycles, low time dedication, mastery and if necessary other aspects like a story or progression through other side elements.

Having a game be multiplayer is more important than ever. After the Covid-19 pandemic, people used video games as a way to communicate with others, and this hasn't gone away after the pandemic ended. 83% of gamers play online or with others [(Entertainment Software Association, 2022)](../reference-list.md) so having multiplayer appeals to 83% of the target audience. My game will have local multiplayer, but not online multiplayer as I want to keep it free to play and run. However, having no online multiplayer is bad, but as it's a PC game, people can use resources such as Parsec to play together.

Free to play platform fighters have been on the rise recently, with Brawlhalla and Multiversus displaying this most. Their general model is to use in game transactions to unlock characters quicker or buy skins, but I don't need monetisation so won't use this model. These games have seen lots of playtime, with between 5 and 10 million downloads [(SteamSpy, 2023)](../reference-list.md) and 72k videos tagged #multiversus [(Youtube, 2023)](../reference-list.md). The popularity of MultiVersus shows the instant popularity a free to play platform fighter has, but as MultiVersus also has Warner Bros ip's it's not a fair measure. Brawlhalla is a free to play platform fighter that started with their own characters, has between 20 and 50 million downloads [(SteamSpy, 2023) ](../reference-list.md)showing that having original characters doesn't matter, and showing the appeal of free to play games.

Easy to pick up. Platform fighters are easier to pick up than fighters due to them having all the charcteristics of platformers. They have easier to understand controls (for example special and right instead of a special left stick input), easier mechanics (as percent is clearly displayed and knockback makes sense) and you don't need[ ](https://web.archive.org/web/20211006230937/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html)much more knowledge than the attack button does damage and smash attacks kill but are slower.&#x20;

Having a low time investment means that people can fit it into any time they have. Platform fighters are match based, meaning everything resets at the end of each match. This results in the time spent playing the game being based on how many matches have been played. With most platform fighters, these matches are short and limited by a timer. This timer can vary, being defaulted to 8 minutes in Rivals of Aether, 7 in Multiversus, 6 in Nickelodeon All Star Brawl and Smash Ultimate allowing you to queue for 7, 6, 5, 4 or 3 minute games. The fact that people can have 3 minute games in one of the most popular platform fighters shows how little time matches can take. This is a good thing, because being able to have an enjoyable match in a small amount of time means that players can play the game in any free time that they have.&#x20;

Platform fighters having replayability is one of the most important parts of the genre. If you took a good look at the mechanics behind them, it feels like more complex Chess. In both Chess and platform fighters, every match can play out exactly the same if the same inputs are provided, both players are aware of the others' potential movements, multiple different openings or characters, every hit taken is either a trade or a blunder and if played perfectly, both games will end in a draw. However, while Chess can be played perfectly, platform fighters can't. Whilst providing the strategy of Chess, they provide fast paced gameplay based on reactions (closer to blitz), have a whole stage rather than an 8x8 board, only one piece but many more options to have to consider and a more offensive game based on predictions and restricting movement. My point here is that chess was made in the 16th century (Chess.com, 2023) and is replayable enough that 1 billion games of Chess have been played on Chess.com in the first 7 years of it's operations (Pete, 2014), then a more complex game is even more replayable.
