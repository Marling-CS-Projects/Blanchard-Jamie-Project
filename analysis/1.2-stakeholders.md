# 1.2 Stakeholders

I'm making a platform fighter because they combine a large number of the gaming industry's innovations into one genre. It can incorporate multiplayer, single-player, fast feedback cycles, low time dedication, mastery and if necessary other aspects like a story or progression through other side elements.

### Multiplayer

Platform fighters are designed around being played with other people. Having a game be multiplayer is more important than ever. After the Covid-19 pandemic, people used video games as a way to communicate with others, and this hasn't gone away since the pandemic ended. 83% of gamers play online or with others [(Entertainment Software Association, 2022)](../reference-list.md) so having multiplayer appeals to 83% of the target audience. My game will have local multiplayer, but not online multiplayer as I want to keep it free to play and run. Besides, having no online multiplayer can be fixed if the consumer uses a remote desktop application like Parsec. However, 17% of consumers don't play online. I can try to appeal to them by adding a way to play single-player in the form of an AI player so that people playing alone can still enjoy the game.

### Ease of Learning

Platform fighters are easy to pick up due to them having all the characteristics of platformers, which have simple controls. They have basic horizontal movement (either pointing the stick right to move right or pressing the right arrow/key to move right), slightly more complex vertical movement (with a jump and a mid-air jump but still taken from traditional platforming controls) and aside from that, players need to learn that light attacks are fast and do little damage, heavy attacks do more damage but are slower and special attacks are unique. Aside from controls, you just need to know that you want to damage your opponents to have a good chance.

### Time Investment

Having a low time investment means that people can fit it into any time they have. Platform fighters are match-based, meaning everything resets at the end of each match. This means the time spent playing the game is based on how many matches have been played. With most platform fighters, these matches are short and limited by a timer. This timer can vary, being defaulted to 8 minutes in Rivals of Aether, 7 in Multiversus, 6 in Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl and Smash Ultimate allowing you to queue for 7, 6, 5, 4, or 3-minute games. The fact that people can have 3-minute games in one of the most popular platform fighters shows how little time matches can take. This is a good thing because being able to have an enjoyable match in a small amount of time means that players can play the game in any free time that they have.&#x20;

### The Free-to-Play Model

Free-to-play platform fighters have been on the rise recently, with Brawlhalla and Multiversus displaying this most. Their general model is to use in-game transactions to unlock characters quicker or buy skins, but I don't need monetization so won't use this model. These games have seen lots of playtimes, with between 5 and 10 million downloads [(SteamSpy, 2023)](../reference-list.md) and 72k videos tagged #multiversus [(Youtube, 2023)](../reference-list.md). The popularity of MultiVersus shows the instant popularity a free-to-play platform fighter has, but as MultiVersus also has Warner Bros' assets it's not a fair measure. Brawlhalla on the other hand is a free-to-play platform fighter that started with their own characters and has between 20 and 50 million downloads [(SteamSpy, 2023) ](../reference-list.md)showing that having original characters doesn't matter and showing the appeal of free-to-play games.

### Replayability

Platform fighters having replayability is one of the most important parts of the genre, as they have similar replayability and complexity to Chess. In both Chess and platform fighters, every match plays out exactly the same if the same inputs are provided, both players are aware of the others' movements and every hit taken is either a trade or a blunder. However, whilst providing the strategy of Chess, they provide fast-paced gameplay based on reactions and fast dopamine hits with a larger area of play, more options to consider and frames based rather than turn based gameplay.&#x20;

### The Importance of Replayability

This is significant because chess was made in the 16th century (Chess.com, 2023) and is replayable enough that 1 billion games of Chess have been played on Chess.com in the first 7 years of its operations (Chess.com, 2014). Having this kind of replayability means players can enjoy the game for as long as they want, instead of when the story ends

### PEGI Ratings

PEGI ratings are age ratings that are respected throughout Europe. Ratings are done by age, so the age rating given dictates what the lowest age of people is likely to be. Having a lower age rating is a good thing because then more people will be playing the game, so it's good to avoid properties that would give your game a higher age rating when possible.

The best example of how to avoid having a high PEGI rating for a platform fighter is the Super Smash Bros series. The Super Smash Bros. series originally was rated a 7 for its N64 release and was then given a 3 for Smash Bros. Melee on the Gamecube. However, with the release of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, it was changed to a 12 [(Pegi, 2023)](../reference-list.md) due to the realism of the graphics and the introduction of Solid Snake, who uses real weaponry in the form of rocket launchers and grenades. This tradition was kept into its sequels, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS, Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, with them involving more characters like Solid Snake (Bayonetta and Joker).

A better example of how to keep a good rating is Brawlhalla, Rivals of Aether and Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl, which all are rated 7 [(Pegi, 2023)](../reference-list.md). Brawlhalla, while having guns, has a more cartoony look, Rivals of Aether has much more pixellated graphics and no direct weapons (outside of its consumer-made content through Steam Workshop) and Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl has a more cartoony look. This means I should try to aim for a 7 with my game and to obtain this rating I should use a similar style of pixellated graphics to Rivals of Aether.

### Conclusion

This means my demographic is mostly people who play multiplayer games, who have at least a familiarity with platformers, have any amount of time to spare, any amount of money, prefer replayability over story-driven games and are above 7.
