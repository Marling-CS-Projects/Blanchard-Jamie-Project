# 1.2 Stakeholders

I'm making a platform fighter because it combines a large number of the gaming industry's innovations into one genre. It can incorporate multiplayer (or single-player), fast feedback cycles, low time dedication, mastery and if necessary other aspects like a story or progression through other side elements. This also allows me to appeal to people who play platformers or fighting games.

## Reasons for playing video games

The above graph [(Dsouza, 2021)](../reference-list.md) demonstrates the most common reasons people in Britain claimed on a survey that they play video games.&#x20;

The most common reason across all age groups is to relax and wind down. This is generally hard to achieve with platform fighters, due to the precision and intense nature of fighting games and the technical inputs required. These factors, however, only apply to competitive play. If a platform fighter is played casually with a friend or against an AI then it can be relaxing as you can use muscle memory or "autopilot".&#x20;

Platform fighters are very good at passing the time, as if you only have a limited amount of time, you can set the in game timer to a limited time. If you however have a long period of time to pass, you can play as many matches as fit the time period due to its replayability.

Due to the graphics of some platform fighters like Rivals of Aether and the unrealistic movement options and superpowers granted to fighters in most games, platform fighters are good to escape reality and do things you can't in real life.

Platform fighter (due to their complex nature) can challenge the player to get better at the mechanics and to understand their opponent's decision making process better to beat them easier. This also fits to allow players to gain mastery.

### Multiplayer

Platform fighters are designed around being played with other people. Having a game be multiplayer is more important than ever. After the Covid-19 pandemic, people used video games as a way to communicate with others, and this hasn't changed since the pandemic ended. 83% of gamers play online or with others [(Entertainment Software Association, 2022)](../reference-list.md) so having multiplayer appeals to 83% of the target audience. My game will have local multiplayer, but not online multiplayer as I want to keep it free to play and run. Besides, having no online multiplayer can be fixed if the consumer uses a remote desktop application like Parsec. I can also add a single player mode to appeal to the remaining 17%.

### Ease of Learning

Platform fighters are easy to pick up due to them having all the characteristics of platformers, which have simple controls. They have basic horizontal movement (either pointing the stick right to move right or pressing the right arrow/key to move right), slightly more complex vertical movement (with a jump and a mid-air jump but still taken from traditional platforming controls) and aside from that, players need to learn that light attacks are fast and do little damage, heavy attacks do more damage but are slower and special attacks are unique. Aside from controls, you just need to know that you want to damage your opponents to have a good chance. This allows anyone who understands platformers to be able to pick up a platform fighter.

### Replayability

As 31 million copies of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate have been sold [(VGSales, 2023)](../reference-list.md) and a total of 19.5 billion games have been played, the average person who bought Smash Bros played 630 games, so these games need to avoid being repetitive to make users want to continue playing.&#x20;

They accomplish this by having similar replayability and complexity to chess. In both chess and platform fighters, every match plays out exactly the same if the same inputs are provided, both players are aware of the other's movements and every hit taken is either a trade or a blunder. This model worked for chess, as despite chess existing since the 16th century (Chess.com, 2023) and yet, in the first 7 years of Chess.com operating 1 billion games were played on the platform [(Chess.com, 2014)](../reference-list.md).

&#x20;However, whilst providing the strategy of Chess, they provide fast-paced gameplay based on reactions and fast dopamine hits with a larger area of play, more options to consider and frames based rather than turn based gameplay. However, I think this works in favor of platform fighters, as it gives them a faster feedback cycle and gives players the option of replaying to master inputs.

### PEGI Ratings

PEGI ratings are age ratings that are respected throughout Europe. Ratings are done by age, so the age rating given dictates what the lowest age of people is likely to be. Having a lower age rating is a good thing because then more people will be playing the game, so it's good to avoid properties that would give your game a higher age rating when possible.

The best example of how to avoid having a high PEGI rating for a platform fighter is the Super Smash Bros series. The Super Smash Bros. series originally was rated a 7 for its N64 release and was then given a 3 for Smash Bros. Melee on the GameCube. However, with the release of Super Smash Bros. Brawl, it was changed to a 12 [(Pegi, 2023)](../reference-list.md) due to the realism of the graphics and the introduction of Solid Snake, who uses real weaponry in the form of rocket launchers and grenades. This tradition was kept into its sequels, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS, Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, with them involving more characters like Solid Snake (Bayonetta and Joker).

A better example of how to keep a good rating is Brawlhalla, Rivals of Aether and Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl, which all are rated 7 [(Pegi, 2023)](../reference-list.md). Brawlhalla, while having guns, has a more cartoony look, Rivals of Aether has much more pixellated graphics and no direct weapons (outside of its consumer-made content through Steam Workshop) and Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl has a more cartoony look. This means I should try to aim for a 7 with my game and to obtain this rating I should use a similar style of pixelated graphics to Rivals of Aether.

### Conclusion

This means my demographic is mostly people who play multiplayer games, who have at least a familiarity with platformers, any amount of money, prefer replayability over story-driven games and are above 6.
