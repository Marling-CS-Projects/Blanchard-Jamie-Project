## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Thinking abstractly is important because it removes unnecessary details from problems, making code more streamlined. This can also make the program run better and make code easier to edit. I can accomplish this by

* Making the stage a single entity and sending all functions that interact with it directly to that entity
* Making all moves run through the same function with different parameters for stun and damage
* Making the AI's inputs go through the same function as the player's inputs would have done
* Keeping the background simple with a single colour that it doesn't share with any stage or player assets
* Using simple platformer mechanics for jumping and moving
* Adding a menu where the player can see the controls and change the characters

## Thinking Ahead

This allows me to consider the potential inputs and outputs to understand the interactions in the game. It allows me to know where to go from the starting steps to developing into a full game. To do this effectively I can start by implementing things that will stay constant throughout the development, like the stage and controls, and adapt the rest to it.

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Decomposition is the process of using sub-processes to solve problems\


## Thinking Logically

Where decisions need to be made about what conditions affect the outcome.

## Thinking Concurrently

Which parts of a problem can be solved at the same time
