## Super Smash Bros. Ultimate

#### Overview

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate for the Nintendo Switch is the most recent entry in the Super Smash Bros. series, being a direct upgrade in gameplay, controls and game balance. The main objective is to knock your opponents off the stage to make them lose lives, which you can do by hitting them. Opponents take more knockback the more they're hit. The game is more fast-paced than the previous entry with a larger number of characters, more lives per game, a new buffer system and character reworks. The main game mode is still lives based, but you can also play a timed game based on KO's. You can play with 1-8 people through AI players or a free for all. The game is meant to be the ultimate crossover with 82 playable characters and one of Nintendo's party games with casual elements like items and unique stages, but it still has all the competitive elements seen in competitive events (even if they're aren't any official ones)

### Controls

The game can be played with either a traditional controller (in the form of a Pro Controller or Gamecube controller) or with Joycons (either together or individually). Using the default controls (as all buttons are remappable), the character is moved with the left stick, you can jump with X, Y or pointing the left stick up, attacks and specials are done with A and B respectively in combination with a left stick input for direction and you can shield, dodge and grab with the triggers on the back.

## Smash&#x20;

Note: This has absolutely no relevance to anything but hey, I wrote it and I like it.\
Platform fighters started out as 2d fighters with a slight change, like Savavge Reign, but this does little to distinguish itself from other fighters (Major Mike GamePro [https://retrocdn.net/images/c/c1/GamePro\_US\_075.pdf](https://retrocdn.net/images/c/c1/GamePro\_US\_075.pdf), 1995)(note to self, page 82) From ther, with the release of Outfoxies in 1995, people started to realise the potential people had to deviate from the normal formula. Having normal fighting game mechanics with a larger area to fight in with hazards, multiple levels, unique characters with special attributes and backstories (like a crippled scientist who's also a martial arts master or a monkey with a top hat) and cool areas like fighting on a train. The main change however was the weapons that can be used. They spawn around the map, deal much more damage than traditional attacks and are funny to use (as the items vary from guns to flamethrowers, swords and pies). The game feels like it's designed to innovate on a new genre and make the players feel like they're having a new and exciting experience every time (which game developers had to back when they released for arcade). However, Outfoxies is now only remembered as the first platform fighter, rather than still being played or being remembered for being played ([Burns](http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/the-outfoxies/), 2012). The platform fighter remembered for defining the industry and providing most of the mechanics was Super Smash Bros\
Smash Ultimate was the best selling game of 2022 (Kain, 2023)\
