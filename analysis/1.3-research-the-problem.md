# 1.3 Research

As I'm making a platform fighter, I decided to research some of the most popular platform fighters to pick out elements that make them a success and use them in my game.

## Super Smash Bros. Ultimate

#### Overview

[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (Nintendo, 2018)](../reference-list.md) is the most recent entry in the Super Smash Bros. series, being a direct upgrade from its predecessors in gameplay, controls and game balance. The main objective is to knock your opponents off the stage to make them lose lives, which you can do by hitting them. Opponents take more knockback the more they're hit. The game is more fast-paced than the previous entry in the Super Smash Bros. series with a larger number of characters, more lives per game, a new buffer system and character reworks. The competitive ruleset uses 3 lives per character. You can play with 1-8 people through AI players or a free for all. The game is meant to be both the ultimate crossover of characters from a large variety of series (with 82 playable characters) and one of Nintendo's party games with casual elements like items and unique stages, but it still has enough competitive elements to have tournaments (even if they're not official).

### Controls

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A Pro Controller and two Joycons</p></figcaption></figure>

The game can be played with either a traditional controller (in the form of a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller or Gamecube controller) or with Joycons (either together or individually). The default controls are underneath, but the general idea is that jump, attack and special are all on the main buttons, movement is done with the joystick and grab/shield is performed with the triggers. This keeps the attack input, special input and jump input near each other, while still making it easy to shield or grab.

While my game won't be playable with a controller, the positioning of the keys relative to each other is important
{% endhint %}

### Design

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate has the most up-to-date graphics in a Super Smash Bros. game, with very realistic character designs. This is to make Ultimate the most engaging game in the franchise as players can relate to realistic designs. This also allows players to see modern versions of some of the characters, as some characters haven't had a game of their own for decades. The design of the stage changes based on the genre, with stages like _75m_ (based on the original Donkey Kong) keeping their art style from the original game, while stages like _Final Destination_ keep the realism that the characters have. This game does have a story, but it's less focused on the characters and more on Galeem and Dharkon - 2 bosses.

| Timer                                         | Having a timer allows people to fit games into any period of time while still having a competitive game, even if it can encourage not engaging your opponent after you have the advantage to wait for the timer to run out. |

## Rivals of Aether

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Rivals of Aether gameplay</p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

[Rivals of Aether](../reference-list.md)[ (Fornace, 2017) ](../reference-list.md)is a platform fighter that puts competitive play above all else. This means you lose features that games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate have, such as items, modern graphics or a large number of characters to choose from. However, this allows Rivals of Aether to have smooth controls, well-balanced characters and a better ranked mode. Rivals of Aether has the same objectives for players that Super Smash Bros. Ultimate has. On top of this, you also have more offensive gameplay due to the smaller stages, lack of shielding or grabbing and introduction of parrying.

### Controls

Rivals, being a PC game, supports a large number of controllers and keyboard while allowing you to bind your own controls. However, the game is built around using an Xbox controller layout, with very similar controls to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. The main changes are that special moves are now done with X, attacks and strong attacks are done with separate buttons and no grab button.\
\
The keyboard controls however are my main focus as my game will be controlled using a keyboard. This game uses the arrow keys for directional input, Z for jump, X for light attacks, Shift for strong attacks, C for special moves and S for shield. This means you control direction with your right hand and your left-hand presses every other button, centered around the jump button (with strong attacks being the easiest to hit).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The default controls shown in the pause menu for controller</p></figcaption></figure>

### Design

The graphics are more pixelated by design, both to make the game state easier to interpret and to avoid a realistic art style. The lack of realism allows players to see the world on their screen as a different one from reality, better allowing them to understand the rules of the game. This game does however have more of a story, with a single-player mode based on fighting in waves and having a score based on a timer. This story goes into detail about the relationship between the characters and results in them all joining forces to fight "The Gatekeepers", this game's bosses.

| Keyboard controls                                          | Having controls focused on Z as jump feels easy to manage, however, I'd have to do the same on a different part of the keyboard for player 2 which there isn't enough space to do |
| The ability to parry and the lack of shielding or grabbing | This makes the game feel faster and less focused on defensive gameplay                                                                                                            |
| The graphics style                                         | Rivals' art style makes the game easier to understand with obvious hit boxes and no distractions                                                                                  |
| The air dodge mechanics                                    | Being able to dash into the ground with low lag is so smooth it makes the player feel like they have more control                                                                 |
| A limiting number of characters                            | Having few characters makes the game easier to balance as well as allowing players to not have to learn too many                                                                  |

| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Character specific gimmicks | Having features like slippery floors or double heavy attacks or tippers adds so much more margin for error when I'm starting with nothing   |
| Controls remapping          | Using one keyboard for 2 players leaves little room to adjust controls, so there's no point in adding a feature that's practically unusable |
| Alternate constumes         | I'm not going to focus on graphics anyway, so there's no point in putting more time into one of the least impactful areas                   |

## Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl gameplay</p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

[Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl](../reference-list.md) [(Nickelodeon, 2021)](../reference-list.md) is Nickelodeon's entry into the platform fighter genre. It's a fast-paced game with a huge variety of characters and play styles. Generally, air speed is fast, dodges have low end-lag, it has shields and grabs but grabs are only worth using to punish a shield and characters are designed to press a lot of buttons. The game began as a competitively focused game but has started introducing more casual aspects like voice lines, sports modes and items.

### Controls

In terms of using a controller, the controls are shared with Rivals of Aether's defaults, but incorporate the grab mechanics of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. For keyboard controls, everything is different. Directional input is still received with arrow keys, but all other keys have multiple inputs. Light attacks are done with Z, A and left Control. Heavy attacks are done with X, Q and Tab. Specials are done with S or either Shift. Defending is done with C, E or left Alt. Grabbing is done with D or defend+attack. Jumping is done with W or Space and strafing is done with right Control. This control scheme is reliant on either having your left thumb on space and the rest of your fingers going to whichever key is most comfortable, or having a closer feel to WASD for attacks.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
I'm not going to bind more than one key to a control due to needing to fit 2 players on one keyboard. This means I'll take inspiration from the best control for each key rather than multiple.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Design

As this is Nickelodeon's game (Nickelodeon is a company that focuses on cartoons), it has a cartoony look, but a polished one to make things more realistic. This allows the game to look more modern and allows characters like Spongebob and Hugh Neutron to appear in the same art style and look natural.

| Respawn mechanics        | Having respawn invincibility while attacking feels unfair for the opponent who has to avoid the invincible player                                                                                                    |
| Faster frame data        | This makes the game more reaction based and feel generally faster                                                                                                                                                    |
| Grounded dodge mechanics | As I plan to use the parry mechanic from Rivals of Aether, I need a way to roll/dodge while performing a parry, so I will use the roll movement from Nickelodeon.                                                    |
| Menus                    | Nickelodeon has good menus as they allow players to multitask. Multiple users can select a character, change the rules, change the number of characters, add AI players and change their cosmetics on the same menu. |

| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Voice lines | I can't make good voice lines, so any I make would detract from the competitive feel of the game |

## The Outfoxies

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (3) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Outfoxies gameplay</p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

The Outfoxies is widely seen as the first platform fighter and is an example of what a platform fighter looks like without the corruption of having to innovate from other games in the genre or how competitive the community is. It has 7 unique characters and 7 unique stages, with a focus on the interaction between the stage and the player. You can play a single-player campaign where you have to kill each of the other 6 characters or you can play in a 1v1 battle against a second player. Items spawn around the stage that heavily influence the battle such as guns, swords or pies, and the stage can harm players.&#x20;

### Controls

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Being made for Arcade systems, the controls during the battle were extremely limiting. The left stick gave directional input (pushing left or right twice in succession making you dash), an attack button attacking and a jump button jumping.

### Design

The game is a 2D (which was uncommon at the time as other games were moving into 3D) sprite-based game with life put into every corner, from the loading screens to the attention to detail in weapons and maps. The characters also have a considerable amount of detail put into them, despite not being based on anything. They're all mercenaries hired to assasinate each other, but they're unique in design and gameplay.&#x20;

John Smith is an every man with average stats.&#x20;

Betty Doe is a business woman with similar stats.&#x20;

Prof. Ching, an 82 year old scientist in a wheelchair who's weak vertically but powerful horizontally.&#x20;

Bernard White, a biomedical engineer with a prosthetic hand that provides superhuman strength.

Danny and Demi, twin children who used to be Siamese but act as if they're still conjoined.

Dweeb, a chimpanzee who was kidnapped to participate.

Eve, a former film star turned criminal with the help of a Lizard.

The entire game feels like a passion project with a considerable amount of detail put into it.&#x20;
