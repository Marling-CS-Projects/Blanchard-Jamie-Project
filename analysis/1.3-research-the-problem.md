### Overview

Note: This has absolutely no relevance to anything but hey, I wrote it and I like it.\
Platform fighters started out as 2d fighters with a slight change, like Savavge Reign, but this does little to distinguish itself from other fighters (Major Mike GamePro [https://retrocdn.net/images/c/c1/GamePro\_US\_075.pdf](https://retrocdn.net/images/c/c1/GamePro\_US\_075.pdf), 1995)(note to self, page 82) From ther, with the release of Outfoxies in 1995, people started to realise the potential people had to deviate from the normal formula. Having normal fighting game mechanics with a larger area to fight in with hazards, multiple levels, unique characters with special attributes and backstories (like a crippled scientist who's also a martial arts master or a monkey with a top hat) and cool areas like fighting on a train. The main change however was the weapons that can be used. They spawn around the map, deal much more damage than traditional attacks and are funny to use (as the items vary from guns to flamethrowers, swords and pies). The game feels like it's designed to innovate on a new genre and make the players feel like they're having a new and exciting experience every time (which game developers had to back when they released for arcade). However, Outfoxies is now only remembered as the first platform fighter, rather than still being played or being remembered for being played ([Burns](http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/the-outfoxies/), 2012). The platform fighter remembered for defining the industry and providing most of the mechanics was Super Smash Bros\
Smash Ultimate was the best selling game of 2022 (Kain, 2023)\
