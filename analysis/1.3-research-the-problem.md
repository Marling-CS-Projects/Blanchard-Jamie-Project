# 1.3 Research

I have researched some of the most popular platform fighters to pick out elements that make them a success, so I can use these in my game.

## Super Smash Bros Ultimate

#### Overview

[Super Smash Bros Ultimate (Nintendo, 2018)](../reference-list.md) is the most recent entry in the Super Smash Bros. series. It is a direct upgrade from its predecessors' gameplay, controls and character balance.

The main objective is to try to make your opponent lose lives by knocking them off the screen when striking them. Opponents take more knockback, being pushed away, the more damage they have taken.

The game is faster-paced than its predecessor. It features:

* a larger number of characters
* more lives per game
* a new buffer system
* character improvements.

In the default game configuration, each character starts the games with 3 lives. You can have 1-8 players (people or AI).

The game is intended to be:

* the ultimate crossover of characters from a large variety of other games (82 playable characters)
* a Nintendo's party game, with casual elements like items and unique stages.

### Controls

The game can be played with either:

* traditional controllers (Nintendo Switch Pro Controller or Gamecube controller)
* Joycons (individually or together).

The default controls (see image below) are:

* Main buttons: jump, attack and special attack
* Left joystick: movement
* Triggers: grab and shield.

This configuration keeps the attack input, special input and jump input near each other, while still making it easy to shield or grab.

While my game won't be playable with a controller, the positioning of the keys relative to each other is important
{% endhint %}

### Design

Super Smash Bros Ultimate has the most up-to-date graphics of any Super Smash Bros. game, with very realistic character designs. This makes it the most engaging game in the franchise as players can relate to realistic designs. Players can see modern versions of characters, as some characters haven't had a game (outside of the Smash Bros series) for decades. The design of the stages are varied:

* _75m_ is based on the early Donkey Kong arcade games. It kept its original art style
* _Final Destination_ is exclusive to Super Smash Bros so shares the realistic design characters have

This game has a story focused on Galeem and Dharkon (2 bosses) rather than the characters.

## Rivals of Aether

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Rivals of Aether gameplay</p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

[Rivals of Aether](../reference-list.md)[ (Fornace, 2017) ](../reference-list.md)is a platform fighter that focuses on competitive play. It lacks some features that games like Super Smash Bros Ultimate have, such as:

* items
* modern graphics
* a large number of characters to choose from.

However, this simplicity allows Rivals of Aether to focus on:

* smooth controls
* well-balanced characters
* a better ranked mode.

Rivals of Aether has the same gameplay objectives as Super Smash Bros Ultimate. It has more offensive gameplay due to the smaller stages, lack of shielding or grabbing and the introduction of parrying.

### Controls

Rivals is a PC game.

It was designed to be used with an Xbox controller layout, but it provides a different layout for keyboards.

The main differences to Super Smash Bros Ultimate are:

* X is used for special moves
* Separate buttons are used for attacks and strong attacks.

\
The keyboard controls are my main focus as my game will be controlled using a keyboard. Rivals uses:

* arrow keys: directional input
* Z: jump
* X: light attacks
* Shift: strong attacks
* C: special moves
* S: parry.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The default controls shown in the pause menu for controller</p></figcaption></figure>

This keyboard layout means players hands are used to control:

* right hand: directional inputs
* left hand: all other buttons, centred around the jump button (with strong attacks being the easiest to hit).

### Design

The graphics are pixelated by design. This is an artistic choice that also helps ensure smooth gameplay. The lack of realism allows players to see the world on their screen as a different one from reality. This game does have a story, with a single player mode based on fighting in waves and having a score based on a timer. This story goes into detail about the relationship between the characters and results in them all joining forces to fight "The Gatekeepers", this game's bosses.

| Keyboard controls                                          | Having controls centred around Z as jump is easy for one player to use and learn, but I need to accommodate two players on different areas of a single keyboard |

| The air dodge mechanics                                    | Being able to dash into the ground with low lag is so smooth it makes the player feel like they have more control                                               |
| A limiting number of characters                            | Having few characters makes the game easier to balance as well as allowing players to not have to learn too many                                                |

## Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl gameplay</p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

<mark style="color:red;">RESTART HERE and in 1.2</mark>

[Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl](../reference-list.md) [(Nickelodeon, 2021)](../reference-list.md) is Nickelodeon's entry into the platform fighter genre. It's a fast-paced game with a huge variety of characters and play styles. Generally, air speed is fast, dodges have low end-lag, it has shields and grabs but grabs are only worth using to punish a shield and characters are designed to press a lot of buttons. The game began as a competitively focused game but has started introducing more casual aspects like voice lines, sports modes and items.

### Controls

In terms of using a controller, the controls are shared with Rivals of Aether's defaults, but incorporate the grab mechanics of Super Smash Bros Ultimate. For keyboard controls, everything is different. Directional input is still received with arrow keys, but all other keys have multiple inputs. Light attacks are done with Z, A and left Control. Heavy attacks are done with X, Q and Tab. Specials are done with S or either Shift. Defending is done with C, E or left Alt. Grabbing is done with D or defend+attack. Jumping is done with W or Space and strafing is done with right Control. This control scheme is reliant on either having your left thumb on space and the rest of your fingers going to whichever key is most comfortable, or having a closer feel to WASD for attacks.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
I'm not going to bind more than one key to a control due to needing to fit 2 players on one keyboard. This means I'll take inspiration from the best control for each key rather than multiple.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Design

As this is Nickelodeon's game (Nickelodeon is a company that focuses on cartoons), it has a cartoony look, but a polished one to make things more realistic. This allows the game to look more modern and allows characters like Spongebob and Hugh Neutron to appear in the same art style and look natural.

| Faster frame data        | This makes the game more reaction based and feel generally faster                                                                                                                                                    |
| Grounded dodge mechanics | As I plan to use the parry mechanic from Rivals of Aether, I need a way to roll/dodge while performing a parry, so I will use the roll movement from Nickelodeon.                                                    |
| Menus                    | Nickelodeon has good menus as they allow players to multitask. Multiple users can select a character, change the rules, change the number of characters, add AI players and change their cosmetics on the same menu. |

| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Voice lines | I can't make good voice lines, so any I make would detract from the competitive feel of the game |

## The Outfoxies

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (3) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Outfoxies gameplay</p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

The Outfoxies is widely seen as the first platform fighter and is an example of what a platform fighter looks like without the corruption of having to innovate from other games in the genre or how competitive the community is. It has 7 unique characters and 7 unique stages, with a focus on the interaction between the stage and the player. You can play a single-player campaign where you have to kill each of the other 6 characters or you can play in a 1v1 battle against a second player. Items spawn around the stage that heavily influence the battle such as guns, swords or pies, and the stage can harm players.&#x20;

### Controls

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Being made for Arcade systems, the controls during the battle were extremely limiting. The left stick gave directional input (pushing left or right twice in succession making you dash), an attack button attacking and a jump button jumping.

### Design

The game is a 2D (which was uncommon at the time as other games were moving into 3D) sprite-based game with life put into every corner, from the loading screens to the attention to detail in weapons and maps. The characters also have a considerable amount of detail put into them, despite not being based on anything. They're all mercenaries hired to assasinate each other, but they're unique in design and gameplay.&#x20;

John Smith is an every man with average stats.&#x20;

Betty Doe is a business woman with similar stats.&#x20;

Prof. Ching, an 82 year old scientist in a wheelchair who's weak vertically but powerful horizontally.&#x20;

Bernard White, a biomedical engineer with a prosthetic hand that provides superhuman strength.

Danny and Demi, twin children who used to be Siamese but act as if they're still conjoined.

Dweeb, a chimpanzee who was kidnapped to participate.

Eve, a former film star turned criminal with the help of a Lizard.

The entire game feels like a passion project with a considerable amount of detail put into it.&#x20;
