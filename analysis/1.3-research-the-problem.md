## Super Smash Bros. Ultimate

#### Overview

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate for the Nintendo Switch is the most recent entry in the Super Smash Bros. series, being a direct upgrade in gameplay, controls and game balance. The main objective is to knock your opponents off the stage to make them lose lives, which you can do by hitting them. Opponents take more knockback the more they're hit. The game is more fast-paced than the previous entry with a larger number of characters, more lives per game, a new buffer system and character reworks. The main game mode is still lives based, but you can also play a timed game based on KO's. You can play with 1-8 people through AI players or a free for all. The game is meant to be the ultimate crossover with 82 playable characters and one of Nintendo's party games with casual elements like items and unique stages, but it still has all the competitive elements seen in competitive events (even if they're aren't any official ones)

### Controls

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A Pro Controller and two Joycons</p></figcaption></figure>

The game can be played with either a traditional controller (in the form of a Pro Controller or Gamecube controller) or with Joycons (either together or individually). Using the default controls (as all buttons are remappable), the character is moved with the left stick, you can jump with X, Y or pointing the left stick up, attacks and specials are done with A and B respectively in combination with a left stick input for direction (with strong attacks being done by moving the stick more harshly before pressing A) and you can shield, dodge and grab with the triggers on the back.

### Design

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate has the most up-to-date graphics in a Smash Bros. game, with very realistic character designs. This is to make Ultimate the most engaging game in the franchise and more realism for the player to connect with the game. The design of the stage changes based on the genre, with stages like 75m (based on the original Donkey Kong) keeping their art style from the original game, while stages like Final Destination keep the realism that the characters have. This game does have a story, but it's less focused on the characters and more on Galeem and Dharkon, 2 bosses.

## Rivals of Aether

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Rivals of Aether gameplay</p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

Rivals of Aether is a platform fighter that puts competitive play above all else. While this means you lose other features that games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate have like items, modern graphics, single-player modes (outside of a small story mode) or a larger character selection, you have smooth controls, well-balanced characters and a better ranked mode. On top of this you also have more offensive gameplay as you can't grab instead of shielding, you can parry.

### Controls

Rivals, being a PC game, supports a large number of controllers. You can use controllers of any kind or keyboard, all of which with remappable keys. However, the game is built around you using an Xbox controller-style layout, with very similar controls to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. The main changes are that special moves are now done with X, attacks and strong attacks are done with separate buttons and no grab button.

### Design

The graphics are more pixelated by design, both to make the game state easier to interpret as fewer things are happening and to avoid looking too realistic. The lack of realism allows players to see the world on their screen as a different one from the real one, better allowing them to understand the rules of the game. This game does however have more of a story, with a single-player mode based on fighting in waves and having a score based on a timer. This story goes into detail about the relationship between the characters and results in them all joining forces to fight The Gatekeepers.

## Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl gameplay</p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl is Nickelodeon's entry into the platform fighter genre. It's a fast-paced game with a huge variety of characters and playstyles. Generally, air speed is fast, dodges have low end lag and characters are designed to press a lot of buttons. The game started as a competitively focused game but has started introducing more casual aspects like voice lines, sports modes and items.

### Controls

controls find the defaults I'm tired...

### Design

As this is Nickelodeon's game, it has a cartoony look, but a polished one to make things more realistic and so the game looks more modern. This model allows characters like Spongebob and Hugh Neutron to both appear in the same art style and look normal, as well as allowing the game to look like a modern attempt at a platform fighter, which was Nickelodeon's goal.&#x20;

## Smash&#x20;

Note: This has absolutely no relevance to anything but hey, I wrote it and I like it.\
Platform fighters started out as 2d fighters with a slight change, like Savavge Reign, but this does little to distinguish itself from other fighters (Major Mike GamePro [https://retrocdn.net/images/c/c1/GamePro\_US\_075.pdf](https://retrocdn.net/images/c/c1/GamePro\_US\_075.pdf), 1995)(note to self, page 82) From ther, with the release of Outfoxies in 1995, people started to realise the potential people had to deviate from the normal formula. Having normal fighting game mechanics with a larger area to fight in with hazards, multiple levels, unique characters with special attributes and backstories (like a crippled scientist who's also a martial arts master or a monkey with a top hat) and cool areas like fighting on a train. The main change however was the weapons that can be used. They spawn around the map, deal much more damage than traditional attacks and are funny to use (as the items vary from guns to flamethrowers, swords and pies). The game feels like it's designed to innovate on a new genre and make the players feel like they're having a new and exciting experience every time (which game developers had to back when they released for arcade). However, Outfoxies is now only remembered as the first platform fighter, rather than still being played or being remembered for being played ([Burns](http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/the-outfoxies/), 2012). The platform fighter remembered for defining the industry and providing most of the mechanics was Super Smash Bros\
Smash Ultimate was the best selling game of 2022 (Kain, 2023)\
