#### Overview

[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (Nintendo, 2018)](../reference-list.md) for the Nintendo Switch is the most recent entry in the Super Smash Bros. series, being a direct upgrade from its predecessors in gameplay, controls and game balance. The main objective is to knock your opponents off the stage to make them lose lives, which you can do by hitting them. Opponents take more knockback the more they're hit. The game is more fast-paced than the previous entry in the Super Smash Bros. series with a larger number of characters, more lives per game, a new buffer system and character reworks. The main game mode is still lives based, but you can also play a timed game based on KO's. You can play with 1-8 people through AI players or a free for all. The game is meant to be the ultimate crossover of characters from a large variety of series with 82 playable characters and one of Nintendo's party games with casual elements like items and unique stages, but it still has enough competitive elements to have tournaments (even if they're not official).

### Controls

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A Pro Controller and two Joycons</p></figcaption></figure>

The game can be played with either a traditional controller (in the form of a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller or Gamecube controller) or with Joycons (either together or individually). The default controls are underneath, but the general idea is that jump, attack and special are all on the main buttons, movement is done with the joystick and grab/shield is performed with the triggers. This keeps the attack input, special input and jump input near each other, while still making it easy to shield or grab.

### Design

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate has the most up-to-date graphics in a Super Smash Bros. game, with very realistic character designs. This is to make Ultimate the most engaging game in the franchise as players can relate to realistic designs. This also allows players to see a more modern version of some of the characters, as some characters haven't had a game of their own for decades. The design of the stage changes based on the genre, with stages like _75m_ (based on the original Donkey Kong) keeping their art style from the original game, while stages like _Final Destination_ keep the realism that the characters have. This game does have a story, but it's less focused on the characters and more on Galeem and Dharkon - 2 bosses.

## Rivals of Aether

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Rivals of Aether gameplay</p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

[Rivals of Aether](../reference-list.md)[ (Fornace, 2017) ](../reference-list.md)is a platform fighter that puts competitive play above all else. This means you lose features that games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate have, such as items, modern graphics or a large number of characters to choose from. However, this allows Rivals of Aether to have smooth controls, well-balanced characters and a better ranked mode. Rivals of Aether has the same objectives for players that Super Smash Bros. Ultimate has. On top of this, you also have more offensive gameplay due to the smaller stages, lack of shielding or grabbing and introduction of parrying.

### Controls

Rivals, being a PC game, supports a large number of controllers. You can use controllers of any kind or keyboard, all of which with remappable keys. However, the game is built around you using an Xbox controller-style layout, with very similar controls to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. The main changes are that special moves are now done with X, attacks and strong attacks are done with separate buttons and no grab button.\
\
The keyboard controls however are my main focus as my game will likely be controlled using a keyboard. The keyboard features remappable keys as well, but most people will use the defaults. This game uses the arrow keys for directional input, Z for jump, X for light attacks, Shift for strong attacks, C for special moves and S for shield. This means you control direction with your right hand and your left-hand presses every other button, centred around the jump button (with strong attacks being the easiest to hit).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The default controls shown in the pause menu when playing on keyboard</p></figcaption></figure>

### Design

The graphics are more pixelated by design, both to make the game state easier to interpret as fewer things are happening and to use a not realistic art style. The lack of realism allows players to see the world on their screen as a different one from reality, better allowing them to understand the rules of the game. This game does however have more of a story, with a single-player mode based on fighting in waves and having a score based on a timer. This story goes into detail about the relationship between the characters and results in them all joining forces to fight "The Gatekeepers", this game's bosses.

## Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl gameplay</p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

[Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl](../reference-list.md) [(Nickelodeon, 2021)](../reference-list.md) is Nickelodeon's entry into the platform fighter genre. It's a fast-paced game with a huge variety of characters and playstyles. Generally, air speed is fast, dodges have low end-lag, it has shields and grabs but grabs are only worth using to punish a shield and characters are designed to press a lot of buttons. The game began as a competitively focused game but has started introducing more casual aspects like voice lines, sports modes and items.

### Controls

In terms of using a controller, the controls are shared with Rivals of Aether's defaults, but incorporate the grab mechanics of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. For keyboard controls, everything is different. Directional input is still received with arrow keys, but all other keys have multiple inputs. Light attacks are done with Z, A and left Control. Heavy attacks are done with X, Q and Tab. Specials are done with S or either Shift. Defending is done with C, E or left Alt. Grabbing is done with D or defend+attack. Jumping is done with W or Space and strafing is done with right Control. This control scheme is reliant on either having your left thumb on space and the rest of your fingers going to whichever key is most comfortable, or having a closer feel to WASD for attacks.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
I'm not going to bind more than one key to a control due to needing to fit 2 players on one keyboard. This means I'll take inspiration from the best control for each key rather than multiple.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Design

As this is Nickelodeon's game (Nickelodeon is a company that focuses on cartoons), it has a cartoony look, but a polished one to make things more realistic. This allows the game to look more modern and allows characters like Spongebob and Hugh Neutron to appear in the same art style and look natural.

## The Outfoxies

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (3) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Outfoxies gameplay</p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

The Outfoxies is widely seen as the first platform fighter and is an example of what a platform fighter looks like without the corruption of having to innovate from other games in the genre or how competitive the community is. It has 7 unique characters and 7 unique stages, with a focus on the interaction between the stage and the player. You can play a single-player campaign where you have to kill each of the other 6 characters or you can play in a 1v1 battle against a second player. Items spawn around the stage that heavily influence the battle such as guns, swords or pies, and the stage can harm players.&#x20;

### Controls

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Being made for Arcade systems, the controls during the battle were extremely limiting. The left stick gave directional input (pushing left or right twice in succession making you dash), an attack button attacking and a jump button jumping.

### Design

The game is a 2D (which was uncommon at the time as other games were moving into 3D) sprite-based game with life put into every corner, from the loading screens to the attention to detail in weapons and maps. The entire game feels like a passion project with a considerable amount of detail put into it.&#x20;
