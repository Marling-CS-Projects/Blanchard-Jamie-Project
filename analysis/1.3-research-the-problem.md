# 1.3 Research

I have researched some of the most popular platform fighters to pick out elements that make them a success, so I can use these in my game.

## Super Smash Bros Ultimate

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Super Smash Bros Ultimate gameplay screenshot</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Overview

[Super Smash Bros Ultimate (Nintendo, 2018)](../reference-list.md) is the most recent entry in the Super Smash Bros. series. It is a direct upgrade from its predecessors' gameplay, controls and character balance.

The main objective is to try to make your opponent lose lives by knocking them off the screen when striking them. Opponents take more knockback, being pushed away, the more damage they have taken.

The game is faster paced than its predecessor. It features:

* A larger number of characters
* More lives per game
* A new buffer system
* Character improvements.

In the default game configuration, each character starts the games with 3 lives. You can have 1-8 players (people or AI).

The game is intended to be:

* The ultimate crossover of characters from a large variety of other games (82 playable characters)
* A Nintendo's party game, with casual elements like items and unique stages.

### Controls

The game can be played with either:

* Traditional controllers - Nintendo Switch Pro Controller or Gamecube controller
* Joycons - Individually or together.

The default controls (see image below) are:

* Main buttons: jump, attack and special attack
* Left joystick: movement
* Triggers: grab and shield.

This configuration keeps the attack input, special input and jump input near each other, while still making it easy to shield or grab.

While my game won't be playable with a controller, the positioning of the keys relative to each other is important
{% endhint %}

### Design

Super Smash Bros Ultimate has the most up-to-date graphics of any Super Smash Bros. game, with very realistic character designs. This makes it the most engaging game in the franchise as players can relate to realistic designs. Players can see modern versions of characters, as some characters haven't had a game (outside of the Smash Bros series) for decades. The designs of the stages are varied:

* _75m_ is based on the early Donkey Kong arcade games. It kept its original art style
* _Final Destination_ is exclusive to Super Smash Bros so shares the realistic design characters have

This game has a story focused on Galeem and Dharkon (2 bosses) rather than the characters.

## Rivals of Aether

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Rivals of Aether gameplay</p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

[Rivals of Aether](../reference-list.md)[ (Fornace, 2017) ](../reference-list.md)is a platform fighter that focuses on competitive play. It lacks some features that games like Super Smash Bros Ultimate have, such as:

* Items
* Modern graphics
* Many characters to choose from.

However, this simplicity allows Rivals of Aether to focus on:

* Smooth controls
* Well-balanced characters
* A better ranked mode.

Rivals of Aether has the same gameplay objectives as Super Smash Bros Ultimate. It has more offensive gameplay due to the smaller stages, lack of shielding or grabbing and the introduction of parrying.

### Controls

Rivals is a PC game.

It was designed to be used with an Xbox controller layout, but it provides a different layout for keyboards.

The main differences to Super Smash Bros Ultimate are:

* X is used for special moves
* Separate buttons are used for attacks and strong attacks.

\
The keyboard controls are my focus. This is because as my game will be controlled using a keyboard. Rivals uses:

* Arrow keys: Directional input
* Z: Jump
* X: Light attacks
* Shift: Strong attacks
* C: Special moves
* S: Parry.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The default controls shown in the pause menu for controller</p></figcaption></figure>

This keyboard layout means players hands are used to control:

* Right hand: Directional inputs
* Left hand: All other buttons, centred around the jump button (with strong attacks being the easiest to hit).

### Design

The graphics are pixelated by design. This is an artistic choice that also helps ensure smooth gameplay. The lack of realism allows players to see the world on their screen as a different one from reality. This game does have a story, with a single player mode based on fighting in waves and having a score based on a timer. This story goes into detail about the relationship between the characters and results in them all joining forces to fight "The Gatekeepers", this game's bosses.

| Keyboard controls                                          | Having controls centred around Z as jump is easy for one player to use and learn, but I need to accommodate two players on different areas of a single keyboard |

| A limiting number of characters                            | Having few characters makes the game easier to balance as well as allowing players to not have to learn too many                                                |

## Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl gameplay</p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

[Nickelodeon: All-Star Brawl](../reference-list.md) [(Nickelodeon, 2021)](../reference-list.md) is a platform fighter made by Nickelodeon. It's fast paced and provides varied characters from different cartoons. For the most part:

* Air speed is fast
* Dodges have low end-lag
* Shielding and grabbing provide a high risk and a low reward
* Characters are designed to use lots of moves in a short space of time

The game began as a competitively focused game but introduced more casual aspects with updates (such as voice lines, new modes and items).

### Controls

While using a controller, the default keybinds are shared with Rivals of Aether. There are significant changes to keyboard controls, such as:

* Z/A/Left Control: Light attacks
* X/Q/Tab: Heavy attacks
* S/Shift: Special attacks
* C/E/Left Alt: Shielding
* D: Grabbing (This can also be done by pressing defend and attack simultaneously)
* W/Space: Jumping

This control scheme is reliant on either having your left thumb on space and the rest of your fingers going to whichever key is most comfortable, or having a closer feel to WASD for attacks.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
I won't bind more than one key to an input due to a lack of space. This means I'll take inspiration from the best control for each key rather than multiple.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Design

As this is Nickelodeon's game (Nickelodeon is a company that focuses on cartoons), it has a cartoony look. Graphics have been refined to make characters look more realistic. This allows the game to look modern. This also makes characters like Spongebob and Hugh Neutron look natural in the same art style.

## The Outfoxies

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (3) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Outfoxies gameplay</p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

The Outfoxies is commonly regarded as the first platform fighter. It is an example of a casual game that laid the foundation for the genre. It has 7 unique characters and stages. You can play a single player campaign where you must assassinate each of the other 6 characters or you can play in a 1v1 battle against a second player. Weapons spawn around the stage that influence the battle such as:

* Guns
* Swords
* Pies&#x20;

### Controls

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Being made for Arcade systems, the controls were limiting.

* Directional input: The joystick (pushing left or right twice in succession making you dash)
* Attack: First button
* Jump: Second button

### Design

The design is limiting as it was made for arcade systems (which limited the hardware). This didn't stop the developers from adding details to characters and stages. The characters are mercenaries hired to assassinate each other. They have different stats and a brief backstory&#x20;

* John Smith: An average man with average stats
* Betty Doe: A businesswoman with similar stats
* Prof. Ching: An 82 year old scientist in a wheelchair who's weak vertically but powerful horizontally.
* Bernard White: A biomedical engineer with a prosthetic hand that provides superhuman strength.
* Danny and Demi: Twin children who used to be Siamese but act as if they're still conjoined.
* Dweeb: A chimpanzee who was kidnapped to participate.
* Eve: A former film star turned criminal with the help of a Lizard.

The game boasts a large amount of detail despite the limiting hardware.
