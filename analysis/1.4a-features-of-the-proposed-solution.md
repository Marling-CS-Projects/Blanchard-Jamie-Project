# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics

### Rules

Each player will have 5 lives and spawn on opposite sides of the stage. Both players' objective is to hit their opponent off the map. This is done by hitting your opponent to deal damage and knockback to them. Knockback will be represented in % and the knockback you take is directly proportional to your %. Once a player goes off the screen border they've lost a life, and after a brief period respawn at the centre. Players respawn with invincibility but this invincibility is lost after using a move.  If you're knocked off the stage but survive, you can try to recover using your mid-air jump (or jumps depending on the character) and your upwards special. The game ends when one player runs out of lives or a 10 minute timer that starts once the game starts runs out. At this point the player with the most lives wins.&#x20;

### Player Inputs

#### Controller

I will make my controls based on the UK English and US Standard keyboard layouts with arrow keys (Specifically any qwerty layout with a semicolon next to L and arrow keys) as they're the most common keyboard layouts in English-speaking countries. As England speaks English, I should make a control set for the most common layout.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt=""><figcaption><p><a href="../reference-list.md">UK Magic Keyboard Layout (Wichary, 2018)</a></p></figcaption></figure>

#### Directional inputs

For directional inputs, I will use WASD and player 1 and arrow keys for player 2. That way, to attack in a specific direction you need to press the key that points in that direction. To move left I will use A and ← respectively. To move right I will use D and → respectively. To fast fall (Increase your falling speed in the air) I will use S and ↓. However I won't use W and ↑ for jumping. This is because jumping is such an important resource, as you only get one midair jump before touching the ground, it needs to be separate from any other input. The arrow keys allow people from other PC platform fighters to control player 2, while people from mouse and keyboard games or controllers where movement is on the left can control player 1. As the controls are also so simple to pick up with all attacks being around one button, anyone can control either player.

| Player 1 | Player 2 | Input                                  |
| -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| W        | ↑        | Directional input up                   |
| A        | ←        | Directional input left and move left   |
| S        | →        | Directional input right and move right |
| D        | ↓        | Directional input down and fastfall    |

#### The Intricacies of the Jump Button

The jump key is a very complicated key, as Rivals of Aether has shown us, controls focused around the jump key make for smoother controls due to limiting the hand movement required and ensuring players always have easy access to jump. This means I should use a key for each player that's easily accessible with one hand so that you can have one hand for moving and another for attacking and can have multiple other keys around it so all the controls are close to each other. This needs to be done while ensuring that the players don't get in each other's way, so I need controls that are far away from each other. This is why I've decided on using G for player 1, and L for player 2.

| Player 1 | Player 2 | Input |
| -------- | -------- | ----- |
| G        | L        | Jump  |

#### Other inputs

My jump keys allow for other buttons to surround them to make other inputs easy to hit. This means I can use F and K for the light attack inputs respectively, T and O for the strong attack inputs respectively and H and ";" for the special attack inputs respectively. This allows both players to have a similar input style for their attack inputs but reversed for each player. This means that players can do light attack inputs and special inputs with their index or ring finger, and their middle finger can press jump or heavy (as you can't do a heavy attack in the air you don't need to press both at once). Lastly, for dodge, I've decided to use Left Shift for player 1 and N for player 2. This is because when using your left hand for "WASD", your pinkie finger is resting over Left Shift and when using your left hand for "OKL;" your pinkie rests over N while staying out of the way of player 1's "TFGH" inputs. This means you don't have to change your positioning to input dodge and the controls feel the same for both players.

| Player 1   | Player 2 | Input           |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------- |
| F          | K        | Light attacks   |
| T          | O        | Heavy attacks   |
| H          | ;        | Special attacks |
| Left Shift | N        | Dodge           |

#### Pause

I'm going to add a pause menu that's bound to Esc or Enter. This will pause the state of the game, display both players' controls and have an option to restart the game (using R), resume the game (using Esc or Enter) or go to the character select screen (with Space).

{% hint style="info" %}
Esc and Enter will pause and unpause the game

While paused, Esc or Enter resumes the game

### Functionality of Inputs

#### Directional inputs

Directional inputs are very important in platform fighters for both movement and attacks. They are important for movement because pressing left or right makes the character move left and right, pressing down allows for fast falling and all directions direct attacks. This means if you're holding right and need to attack left, you need to stop moving right entirely. This is why jump isn't bound to up as otherwise, you need to jump to attack upward. However, this way of inputting directions makes it easier for newer players as they can clearly see what direction moves are going to go.&#x20;

#### Jumping

Jumping is the most important mechanic and one that's extremely limited. With only one midair jump and the ability to jump while grounded, it makes platform fighters very based on aerial movement. Jumps allow you to avoid grounded hits, reach players that are close to the top of the screen or trying to avoid moves, allow yourself to use aerial moves and most importantly recover to the stage. As you only get one midair jump and you only get it back when you touch the stage, a common strategy is to "edge guard" your opponent by trying to hit them before they get back to the stage, either to hit them further away so they have to use their jump and become vulnerable or if they've already used their jump to launch them far enough away that they can't make it back to the stage due to not having a jump.&#x20;

#### Attacks

Moves have a lot of properties that make them unique.

* Damage changes how good a move is when your opponent is at a low percent and still has an impact at a high percent
* Knockback is important for 2 different categories. Scalar knockback is directly proportional to percent, and a high scalar knockback generally means a good killing move. Fixed knockback doesn't change regardless of your opponent's percent, and the lower the fixed knockback the easier it is for moves to combo into other moves, increasing the reward per hit. Knockback is decided with the equation **total knockback=fixed knockback + scalar knockback\*percent/100**.
* Direction of knockback is important as moves that send upwards powerfully can kill off the top, moves that send sideways powerfully can kill at ledge and low power moves can have different strengths and weaknesses depending on the character's move speed, jump height and follow up moves
* Stun increases the potential a move has to combo into other moves, increases the likeliness for a move to kill (as your opponent can't act for longer) and increases the stage control gained from hitting it as your opponent can't gain stage control while stunned. Stun works similarly to knockback in that you have scalar and fixed stun
* Lag decreases the viability of a move as having high start lag means your opponent can hit you before the move starts and having high end lag means your opponent can punish you more easily or with a stronger move if you miss
* Duration can be a benefit and a drawback as a high duration means you have a generous timing for hitting your opponent but too much duration means you're locked into the move for longer so can be punished
* Hitbox size in width and height makes moves easier to hit and outrange other moves, reducing your opponent's counterplay
* Hitbox position is important as having a move above you covers different ground to a move infront of you or a move underneath you, so the position decides when you should use specific moves

Moves are split up into 4 directions and split into light, strong, aerial and special attacks

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Light Attacks" %}
Light attacks are fast attacks, generally having an active hitbox in under 10 frames. They do relatively little damage but combo can into other light attacks or aerials while your opponent hasn't taken much damage. When your opponent has taken more damage, some characters can combo them into kill moves, but they likely won't kill themselves. Some of them can, but they can't combo and are weaker than strong attacks.&#x20;

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Strong Attacks" %}
Strong attacks are slow attacks that deal much more damage and knockback than normal attacks but take generally over 10 frames to start up. They are normally large moves that cover a bigger area of the stage. They don't combo into other moves and have lots of end lag. This makes them risky moves with higher rewards and most times the way to end lives.&#x20;

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Aerial Attacks" %}
Aerials are done with the light or heavy attack button while in the air. They are completely different depending on the character. They can kill, be fast, have a large hitbox, combo and deal lots of damage, but they generally only do one of these. They define how a character can play due to either strengthening or weakening their neutral game, balancing the character

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Special Attacks" %}
Specials, like Aerials, are dependent on the character and display most of the uniqueness of the character. They can have any potential effect in the game, from launching a projectile, reflecting projectiles, grabbing and throwing opponents and stunning opponents. They add individuality to a character to make them feel unique. Upward specials are the most important specials, as on top of having a hitbox normally, they send the user upwards, allowing for a recovery tool if they've used their jump or want to conserve it.

### Characters

Characters have individual stats that separates them from each other to create more unique interactions

* Walk speed determines how much ground a character can cover on the ground in a set amount of time
* Aerial speed determines how much of the air a character can cover
* Jump height determines how high above a character they can cover, which is especially important if your upwards aerial kills or your opponent has a strong downward aerial. It also increases your recovery.
* A character's weight determines what percent they die to specific moves to, making your opponent's hits less valuable
* Fall speed determines how much of the air a character can cover at once, but also makes their recovery worse

## Design

### Art Style

Platform fighters need to be simple to understand. Players need to understand where the hitboxes are, what parts of the stage are interactable, what moves their opponent is doing, when a character is in stun, how damaged their opponent is and so much more. For this reason, art styles should be simplistic, so that it's obvious what's happening. This approach is best shown by Rivals of Aether, using 2d sprites for characters and stages with simplistic designs, where hitboxes are highlighted while still making each character feel unique.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (12) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Screenshot from Rivals of Aether</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Stage and background

The stage will be basic, a single colour that no character or hitbox shares to differentiate it from other elements. It will have a main platform that covers the centre of the screen and walls that go further down that can be jumped off. The background will be a dark colour to highlight the stage and characters so it's easier to tell where people are. The camera will be a fixed camera that showcases the entire stage and boundary of the map to show players all the visual information they need.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Stage Concept Art.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Simple concept art for the stage and background</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Characters and hitboxes

Characters will be simplistically designed, nothing more than a simple shape with a face on it to show an obvious hitbox and location. Hitboxes will be designed similarly, where every active hitbox is the same colour so it's obvious where the hitbox is and how big it is.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/draft characters.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Concept art of designs I plan to add</p></figcaption></figure>

### Sound

I will use publicaly available sound assets to add music and sound effects for hit and death. This will amplify the feel of the game as music can make the players feel more immersed with the game, and having sound effects on hit makes each hit feel more impactful by providing more stimuli. ADD EXAMPLE OF RREE SOUND

### UI

I'll have a start screen with an explanation of the controls, the ability to swap between characters with Q and W or P and O and the ability to choose if you're playing against another player or an AI with L. During the battle, I'll display the damage each player has taken and their remaining lives at the bottom of the screen.

### Ease of controlling

I'll add a buffer system so that if a button is pressed while you're doing a move and the button is held until the move is over, the buffered move will activate. This means players don't have to do a frame perfect (1/60 seconds) button press after every move to act as soon as possible. I will also add quality-of-life options like if you touch the ground during an aerial, the aerial will finish.

## Limitations

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Platform support" %}
Being a .exe file once compiled means it only has Windows support without compatibility layers. This can be solved with other users using a VM but this is a bad solution because it adds extra work for the player.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Performance" %}
Being run locally means it only runs as well as the machine running it can perform, this shouldn't be an issue as there shouldn't be too much for the hardware to run due to it only being 60fps.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Online multiplayer" %}
There will be no online multiplayer, but there will be local multiplayer. This in combination with tools like Parsec can allow people to play online multiplayer at no cost to them or me, however, this creates extra work for the user and is dependent on external tools.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Graphics detail" %}
I'm going to prioritise the gameplay over the looks so the characters and stage will be basic. If I have time I will add animations but I might just keep it as a static sprite with clear hitboxes.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
