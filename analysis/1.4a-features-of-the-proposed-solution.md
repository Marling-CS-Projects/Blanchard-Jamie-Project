# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics

### Rules

Each player will:

* Have 3 lives
* Spawn on opposite sides of the stage
* Attempt to hit their opponent off the screen by landing moves.&#x20;

When you hit your opponent with a move, you will deal damage anc knockback. Knockback will be represented in % (up to 99.9%) and knockback is directly proportional to %.&#x20;

Once a player goes off the screen border, they'll lose a life. After a brief period, they will respawn at the centre with 0%. Players will respawn with invincibility. This invincibility is lost after using a move or 5 seconds have passed.  If you're knocked off the stage but survive, you can try to recover using your mid-air jump (or jumps) and your upwards special. The game ends when:

* one player runs out of lives
* The timer (that lasts 10 minutes) runs out

At this point, the player with the most lives (or lowest percent) wins.&#x20;

### Player Inputs

#### Controller

I will make my controls based on the UK English and US Standard keyboard layouts with arrow keys. This also fits any qwerty layout with a semicolon right of the L key that has arrow keys. These are common keyboard layouts in English speaking countries.

#### Directional inputs

For directional inputs, I will use WASD and player 1 and arrow keys for player 2. That way, to attack in a specific direction you need to press the key that points in that direction.&#x20;

The arrow keys allow people from other PC platform fighters to control player 2, while people from mouse and keyboard games or controllers where movement is on the left can control player 1.

To fast fall (Increase your falling speed in the air) I will use S and ↓.&#x20;

I won't use W and ↑ for jumping. This is because jumping is an important resource, so I should separate it from from any other input.&#x20;

<table><thead><tr><th width="108">Player 1</th><th width="103.33333333333331">Player 2</th><th>Input</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>W</td><td>↑</td><td>Directional input up</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>←</td><td>Directional input left and move left</td></tr><tr><td>S</td><td>→</td><td>Directional input right and move right</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>↓</td><td>Directional input down and fastfall</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### The Intricacies of the Jump Button

The jump key is a complicated key. As Rivals of Aether has shown us, controls focused on the jump key result in smoother controls. This is because it limits the hand movement required and ensures players always have easy access to jump. This means I should use a key that's easily accessible with the remaining hand not being used for movement. This allows me to place multiple keys around. This needs to be done while ensuring that the players don't get in each other's way, so I need controls that are far away from each other. This is why I've decided on using G for player 1, and L for player 2, which are both designed to be pressed with the player's middle finger.

<table><thead><tr><th width="108">Player 1</th><th width="103.33333333333331">Player 2</th><th>Input</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>G</td><td>L</td><td>Jump</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Other inputs

My jump keys allow for other buttons to surround them to make other inputs easy to hit. I can use:

* F and K: Light attack - index (player 1) or ring (player 2) finger
* T and O: Strong attack - middle finger
* H and ";": Special attack - ring (player 1) or index (player 2) finger
* Left Shift and N: Dodge - little finger

This allows both players to have controls similarly placed. As players never need to press jump and heavy at the same time, I can use the middle finger for both. I used Left shift and N because when using your left hand for "WASD", your pinkie finger is resting over Left Shift and when using your left hand for "OKL;" your pinkie rests over N while staying out of the way of player 1's "TFGH" inputs.

#### Pause

There will be a pause menu that's bound to Esc or Enter. This will pause the state of the game while displaying both players' controls. There will be an option to restart the game (using R), resume the game (using Esc or Enter) or go to the character select screen (with Space).

{% hint style="info" %}
Esc and Enter will pause and unpause the game

While paused, Esc or Enter resumes the game
{% endhint %}

### Functionality of Inputs

#### Directional inputs

Directional inputs are important in platform fighters for both movement and attacks. They are important for movement because pressing left or right makes the character move left and right respectively, pressing down allows for fast falling. Moves will also point in the direction being held. This means if you're holding right and need to attack left, you need to stop moving right entirely. This is why jump isn't bound to up as otherwise, you need to jump to attack upward.&#x20;

This also makes it easier for inexperienced players to tell where moves are going to point.&#x20;

#### Jumping

Jumping is the most important mechanic due to it being limited. There are limited mid-air jumps (that refresh when the player touches the ground) and an ability to jump while grounded.&#x20;

Jumps allow you to:

* Avoid grounded hits
* Reach players that are close to the top of the screen or avoiding moves
* Allow yourself to use aerial moves
* Recover to the stage

As you get limited mid-air jumps (traditionally 1 or 2), a common strategy is to "edge guard" your opponent. This means trying to hit them before they get back to the stage, as their options are limited.

#### Attacks

Moves have a lot of properties that make them unique.

* Different moves deal varying amount of damage
* Moves have 2 different types of knockback. Scalar knockback and fixed knockback. Scalar knockback is directly proportional to percent, meaning a high scalar knockback generally means a good killing move. Fixed knockback isn't affected by your opponent's percent, so a low fixed knockback makes it easier to land a follow up move, increasing the reward. Knockback is decided with the equation **total knockback=fixed knockback + scalar knockback\*percent/100**.
* The direction of knockback varies. Kill moves that send upwards can kill off the top, moves that send sideways can kill at the edge of the stage. Low power moves can combo into other moves or be high reward for other reasons.
* Stun is the duration an opponent can't act after being hit by a move. While they can't act, they are unable to change the knockback they're facing. High stun increases the potential a move has to combo into other moves, as well as the likeliness for a move to kill. and increases the stage control gained from hitting it as your opponent can't gain stage control while stunned.
* Lag is the amount of time you must wait before a move starts or after a move ends. High lag decreases the viability of a move. Having high start lag means your opponent can hit you before the move starts. Having high end lag means your opponent can easily punish you if you miss.
* Duration is the amount of time a move lasts. This can be a benefit and a drawback. High duration means you have a generous timing for hitting your opponent, but too much duration means you're locked into the move for longer.
* Hitbox size (width and height) makes moves easier to hit, reducing your opponent's counter play.
* Hitbox position is where the move appears relative to your character. This is important as having a move above you covers different ground to a move in front of you. This decides when you should use specific moves.

Moves are split up into 4 directions and split into light, strong, aerial and special attacks

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Light Attacks" %}
Light attacks are fast attacks, having an active hitbox in under 10 frames. They do relatively minor damage but can combo into some attacks. Some light attacks can kill, but they won't combo into other moves and will deal less damage than strong attacks.&#x20;

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Strong Attacks" %}
Strong attacks are slow attacks that deal more damage and knockback than light attacks. They generally take over 10 frames to start. They are normally large moves, don't combo into other moves and have lots of end lag. This makes them risky moves with higher rewards. They are also a common way to end lives.&#x20;

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Aerial Attacks" %}
Aerials are done with the light or heavy attack button while in the air. They are different depending on the character. They can kill, be fast, have a large hitbox, combo and deal lots of damage, but they generally only perform one of these. They define how a character can play due to either strengthening or weakening their overall potential.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Special Attacks" %}
Specials, like Aerials, are dependent on the character. They display unique characteristics of the character. They can have any potential effect in the game, from launching a projectile, reflecting projectiles, grabbing/throwing opponents and stunning opponents. Upward specials are the most important, as on top of usually dealing damage, they send the user upwards, allowing for a recovery tool.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Characters

Characters have individual stats that separates them from each other.

* Walk speed determines how fast a character moves on the ground
* Aerial speed determines how fast a character can move in the air
* Jump height determines how far they go vertically when jumping. This is split into grounded jump height and aerial jump height
* A character's weight determines how far they get launched by moves
* Fall speed determines how quickly they drop when in the air

### AI

There will be an AI that controls the playable characters by telling the game which inputs they should perform. This provides the player with a single-player experience that should be challenging but beatable.

## Design

### Art Style

Platform fighters need to be simple to understand. Players need to understand where the hitboxes are, what parts of the stage are interactable, what moves their opponent are performing, when a character is in stun, how damaged their opponent is and more. For this reason, art styles should be simplistic. This approach is best shown by Rivals of Aether, using 2d sprites for characters and stages with simplistic designs. Moves are clearly shown while still making each character unique.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (12) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Screenshot from Rivals of Aether</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Stage and background

The stage will be basic, a single colour that no character or hitbox shares. This differentiates it from other elements. It will have a main platform that covers the centre of the screen. The background will be a dark colour to contrast the stage and characters.\
The stage will be selected out of a select few. They will be bright colours that don't overlap with the character's colours. It will have a main platform that covers the centre of the screen. The background will be a darker colour than the characters.\
The camera will be a fixed camera that displays the entire stage and boundary of the map. This shows players all the visual information they need.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Stage Concept Art.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Simple concept art for the stage and background</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Characters and hitboxes

Characters will be simplistically designed, nothing more than a simple shape with a face on it to show an obvious hitbox and location. Moves will be designed similarly, where every active hitbox will be a rectangle with a similar colour to the character to differentiate them form other moves.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/draft characters.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Concept art of designs I plan to add</p></figcaption></figure>

### Sound

I will use public sound assets to add music and sound effects for moves hitting. Music can make the players feel more immersed in the game and having sound effects on hit makes each hit more impactful.

### UI

I'll have a start screen with an explanation of the controls, the ability to swap between characters with Q and W (player 1) or P and O (player 2) and the ability to choose if you're playing against another player or an AI with tab. During the battle, I'll display the damage each player has taken and their remaining lives at the bottom of the screen.

### Ease of controlling

I'll add a buffer system so that if a button is pressed while a move is being performed and the button is held until the move is over, the buffered action will activate. This means players don't have to do a frame perfect (1/60 seconds) button press after every move to act as soon as possible. I will also add quality of life options like if you touch the ground during an aerial, the aerial will finish.

## Limitations

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Platform support" %}
Being a .exe file once compiled means it only has Windows support (without compatibility layers). This can be solved by people on other operating system using a Windows VM. This is a bad solution because it adds extra work for the player.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Performance" %}
Being run locally means it only runs as well as the machine running it can perform. This shouldn't be an issue as the game shouldn't require much computational power due to it only being 60fps.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Online multiplayer" %}
There will be no online multiplayer, but there will be local multiplayer. This in combination with remote desktop tools like Parsec can allow people to play online multiplayer at no cost to them or me. This creates extra work for the user and is dependent on external tools.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Graphics detail" %}
I'm going to prioritise the gameplay over the aesthetics so the characters and stage will be basic. If I have time I will add animations but I will probably just keep it as a static sprite with clear hitboxes.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
