# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics

### Player Inputs

#### Controller

I will make my controls based on the UK English and US Standard keyboard layouts with arrow keys (Specifically any qwerty layout with a semicolon next to L and arrow keys) as they're the most common keyboard layouts in English-speaking countries, and as England speaks English, I should make a control set for the most common layout.

#### Directional inputs

For directional inputs, I will use WASD and player 1 and arrow keys for player 2. That way, to attack in a specific direction you need to press the key that points in that direction. To move left I will use A and ← respectively. To move right I will use D and → respectively. To fast fall (Increase your falling speed in the air) I will use S and ↓. However I won't use W and ↑ for jumping. This is because jumping is such an important resource, as you only get one midair jump before touching the ground, it needs to be separate from any other input. The arrow keys allow people coming from other PC platform fighters to control player 2, while people coming from mouse and keyboard games or controllers where movement is on the left can control player 1. As the controls are also so simple to pick up with all attacks being around one button, anyone can control either player.

#### Explaining the jump button

The jump key is a very complicated key, as Rivals of Aether has shown us, controls focused around the jump key make for smoother controls due to limiting the hand movement required and ensuring players always have easy access to jump. This means I should use a key for each player that's easily accessible with one hand so that you can have one hand for moving and another for attacking and can have multiple other keys around it so all the controls are close to each other. This needs to be done while ensuring that the players don't get in each other's way, so I need controls that are far away from each other.

#### Other inputs

I've decided for this reason to use G to jump for player 1 and L to jump for player 2. These keys are both very far away from each other and provide a similar placement of other attacking inputs. I can then use F and K for the attack inputs respectively, H and ";" for the special attack inputs respectively and T and O for the strong attack inputs respectively. This allows both players to have a similar input style to their attack inputs but reversed for each player. This means that players can do attack inputs and special inputs with their index or ring finger, and their middle finger can press jump or heavy (as you can't do a heavy attack in the air you don't need to press both at once). Lastly, for dodge, I've decided to use Left Shift for player 1 and N for player 2. This is because when using your left hand for "WASD", your pinkie finger is resting over Left Shift and when using your left hand for "OKL;" your pinkie rests over N while staying out of the way of player 1's "TFGH" inputs. This means you don't have to change your positioning to input dodge and the controls feel the same for both players.

### Functionality of inputs

#### Directional inputs

Directional inputs are very important in platform fighters for both movement and attacking.

#### Other controls

jump attacks dodge
