# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* Platform support - It can only be played on Windows
* Menu navigation - The menu can only be navigated with keyboard but having mouse control would be nice
* Lack of stages - I tried in [cycle 9](../design-and-development/2.2.9-cycle-9.md#challenges) to allow for multiple stages, but I couldn't due to lag. This is no longer an issue as I changed framework
* No online support - The game lacks online multiplayer which means people have to be on the same machine to play together
* Graphics - While the graphics are unique, a lack of sprites and animations mean I had to reuse assets. I also never used the colour aspect of moves. Despite programming it in [cycle 8](../design-and-development/2.2.8-cycle-8.md), I only used it for circle's forward light

## Maintenance

I could maintain this project by expanding on the limitations to improve it or by improving current aspects by doing things such as adding more characters or rebalancing current characters.

## Future Development

### Short Term Bug Fixes

As there were no reported bugs, the only fixes would be changing character balance.

### Long Term Addressing Limitations

* Platform support - I could make a version for Mac and Linux or I could make a version in Kaboom so it works on all browsers
* Menu navigation - As I'm now using the DirectX framework, I can add mouse functionality
* Lack of stages - I've already shown in [cycle 9](../design-and-development/2.2.9-cycle-9.md#challenges) that I can add a stage selection so I can make new backgrounds and add them.
* No online support - This would be challenging to connect a local app too, especially if I make multiple versions of the game for compatibility. There also needs to be little lag as platform fighters are precise. This however has been accomplished in Rivals of Aether so is possible.
* Graphics - I would have to develop more sprites or animations (as the DirectX framework allows me to use animations)
