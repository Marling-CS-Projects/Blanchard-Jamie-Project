# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* Platform support - It can only be played on Windows
* Menu navigation - The menu can only be navigated with keyboard but having mouse control would be nice
* Lack of stages - I tried in [cycle 9](../design-and-development/2.2.9-cycle-9.md#challenges) to allow for multiple stages, but I couldn't due to lag. This is no longer an issue as I changed framework
* No online support - The game lacks online multiplayer which means people have to be on the same machine to play together
* Graphics - While the graphics are unique, a lack of sprites and animations mean I had to reuse assets. I also never used the colour aspect of moves. Despite programming it in [cycle 8](../design-and-development/2.2.8-cycle-8.md), I only used it for circle's forward light

Users also reported limitations with the project when I asked how gameplay could be improved

* "Perhaps by adding more characters to add even more options for the player. Also the potential to add cosmetic items to your player before you fight could be fun."

Adding more characters would be interesting as if I got more sprites I could add more archetypes of characters. I could also involve more of my friends by allowing them to make sprites or suggest characters they would want to see

* "The graphics could be upgraded to tell the abilities apart better"
* "more colour variety"
* "make the attacks slightly more visible"

The way moves are displayed has always seemed awkward as there's no difference between different character's moves. I tried to improve this by adding colour to every move, but I never had the time to implement it. This problem was amplified when the DrawRect() function changed in cycle 11/12.

* "More stages in the background would be nice"

This means players want the same upgrades as I'm planning to add which is nice

* Add power ups.

Power ups would be interesting as they would create a similar feel to items in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate or Outfix

* Reduce the game complexity
* heavier feeling characters
* faster movement/attacks&#x20;
* Animations

## Maintenance

I could maintain this project by expanding on the limitations to improve it or by improving current aspects by doing things such as adding more characters or rebalancing current characters.

## Future Development

### Short Term Bug Fixes

As there were no reported bugs, the only fixes would be changing character balance.

### Long Term Addressing Limitations

* Platform support - I could make a version for Mac and Linux or I could make a version in Kaboom so it works on all browsers
* Menu navigation - As I'm now using the DirectX framework, I can add mouse functionality
* Lack of stages - I've already shown in [cycle 9](../design-and-development/2.2.9-cycle-9.md#challenges) that I can add a stage selection so I can make new backgrounds and add them.
* No online support - This would be challenging to connect a local app too, especially if I make multiple versions of the game for compatibility. There also needs to be little lag as platform fighters are precise. This however has been accomplished in Rivals of Aether so is possible.
* Graphics - I would have to develop more sprites or animations (as the DirectX framework allows me to use animations)

### Balancing

As making characters have a very similar strength is important for players to have fun with every character, I asked for feedback from users I can rebalance characters accordingly.

#### Responses

* "The faster characters (especially the Octagon guy) was really hard to play against as they just combo so many times you feel like your just watching the game happen rather than playing it. The pink bird was also difficult to play as a character with that large of a hitbox didnt have any large attacks."&#x20;
* "tiny dog dude demolished the rock guy"
* "Dog was very powerful "
* "nerf trollface"

This shows me that people think the faster characters are more powerful, so I can either nerf their damage, nerf their stun or buff the slower characters. The responses at least give me an idea of who is more powerful.
