# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* Platform support - It can only be played on Windows
* Menu navigation - The menu can only be navigated with keyboard but having mouse control would be nice
* Lack of stages - I tried in [cycle 9](../design-and-development/2.2.9-cycle-9.md#challenges) to allow for multiple stages, but I couldn't due to lag. This is no longer an issue as I changed framework
* No online support - The game lacks online multiplayer which means people have to be on the same machine to play together
* Graphics - While the graphics are unique, a lack of sprites and animations mean I had to reuse assets. I also never used the colour aspect of moves. Despite programming it in [cycle 8](../design-and-development/2.2.8-cycle-8.md), I only used it for circle's forward light

## Maintenance

I could maintain this project by expanding on the limitations to improve it or by improving current aspects by doing things such as adding more characters or rebalancing current characters.

## Future Development

### Short Term Bug Fixes

As there were no reported bugs, the only fixes would be changing character balance.

### Long Term Addressing Limitations

* Platform support - I could make a version for Mac and Linux or I could make a version in Kaboom so it works on all browsers
* Menu navigation - As I'm now using the DirectX framework, I can add mouse functionality
