# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* Platform support - It can only be played on Windows
* Menu navigation - The menu can only be navigated with keyboard but having mouse control would be nice
* Lack of stages - I tried in [cycle 9](../design-and-development/2.2.9-cycle-9.md#challenges) to allow for multiple stages, but I couldn't due to lag. This is no longer an issue as I changed framework
* No online support - The game lacks online multiplayer which means people have to be on the same machine to play together
* Graphics - While the graphics are unique, a lack of sprites and animations mean I had to reuse assets. I also never used the colour aspect of moves. Despite programming it in [cycle 8](../design-and-development/2.2.8-cycle-8.md), I only used it for circle's forward light

Users also reported limitations with the project when I asked how gameplay could be improved

* "Perhaps by adding more characters to add even more options for the player. Also the potential to add cosmetic items to your player before you fight could be fun."

Adding more characters would be interesting as if I got more sprites I could add more archetypes of characters. I could also involve more of my friends by allowing them to make sprites or suggest characters they would want to see

* "More stages in the background would be nice"

This means players want the same upgrades as I'm planning to add which is nice

* "Add power ups."

Power ups would be interesting as they would create a similar feel to items in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate or Outfoxies. This creates more unique interactions and makes the game feel fresh, especially if random items spawn on a random point.

* "Reduce the game complexity"

I obtained this response because I gave the game to people who don't play many video games or games of this genre. While I could ignore these responses as they come from people who wouldn't play this type of game, I could add an easier to understand mode with fewer attacks and controls and slower paced gameplay so it's easy to understand. This would increase the target demographic for my game as more people would be able to understand it.

* "heavier feeling characters"
* "faster movement/attacks"

I've realised the reason the game feels so slow is because of hit stun. Hitstun slows down the pace of the game and throws off timing for players, so it makes the game feel heavy. I decided to remove it entirely to make the game smoother.

## Maintenance

I could maintain this project by expanding on the limitations to improve it or by improving current aspects by doing things such as adding more characters or rebalancing current characters.

## Future Development

### Short Term Bug Fixes

There were no bugs reported by users. However, I found some in my personal testing.&#x20;

When playing in fullscreen mode, the window doesn't go to the very right side of the screen or hide the Windows toolbar, so some controls are hidden in the pause menu. I fixed this by changing the window style to "WS\_VISIBLE | WS\_POPUP" when I make it fullscreen and "WS\_VISIBLE | WS\_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW" on windowed

If you're not tabbed on the window and perform keyboard inputs, the game will still register the inputs. I fixed this by replacing GetKeyState with gfx->ifFocus() && GetKeyState.

If you have 5 projectiles out at one point and try to use a move, it won't activate. As this issue almost exclusively happens with special moves, I made it so that if you have 4 active moves that aren't attached to the player, you can only use a special move if it's up special.

If you lure the AI to the edge of the stage and get it to use a special move, it will fall off the stage. To fix this, I made it so that the AI can't use special moves if they're 200 pixels away from the edges of the stage or closer. I did the same thing with dodges. I also the AI needs to use more powerful moves when the opponent is at a higher percent to make them more challenging to beat.

Most importantly, if Troll Face uses their side special near the edge of the stage on top of the opponent, they will land a hit (which isn't meant to happen) and then keep using the move until they fall off the stage. I stopped them from continuing to use the move when I removed hit stun, but I also changed how the moves work to remove the initial hit.

I also wanted to see if I could use the old version of DrawRect and I quickly found that I could use FillRect so I used FillRect for moves.

### Long Term Addressing Limitations

* Lack of stages - I've already shown in [cycle 9](../design-and-development/2.2.9-cycle-9.md#challenges) that I can add a stage selection so I can make new backgrounds and add them.
* Story - I would like to add a backstory to all of my characters in the form of a brief description of them when you select them
* Menu Navigation - As I'm now using the DirectX framework, I can add mouse functionality
* Graphics - I would have to develop more sprites or animations (as the DirectX framework allows me to use animations)
* Power Ups - As this is a feature that people wanted that would improve the game's replayability, adding them would be vital.
* Platform support - I could make a version for Mac and Linux or I could make a version in Kaboom so it works on all browsers
* No online support - This would be challenging to connect a local app too, especially if I make multiple versions of the game for compatibility. There also needs to be little lag as platform fighters are precise. This however has been accomplished in Rivals of Aether so is possible.

### Balancing

As making characters have very similar power is important for players to have fun with every character, I asked for feedback from users so I could rebalance characters accordingly.

#### Responses

* "The faster characters (especially the Octagon guy) was really hard to play against as they just combo so many times you feel like your just watching the game happen rather than playing it. The pink bird was also difficult to play as a character with that large of a hitbox didnt have any large attacks."&#x20;
* "tiny dog dude demolished the rock guy"
* "Dog was very powerful "
* "nerf trollface"

This shows me that people think the faster characters are more powerful, so I can either nerf their damage, nerf their stun or buff the slower characters. The responses at least give me an idea of who is more powerful.&#x20;

During my own testing, I noticed you can combo circle's down air into itself, eventually into a forward air to take a life away from the opponent after hitting them at 0%.

On top of this, I found it was hard to take an opponent's life with the damage being capped at 99% (unlike similar games like Smash Bros. Ultimate and Rivals of Aether) so I will decrease the weight stat of all characters by 0.1 to fix this.
