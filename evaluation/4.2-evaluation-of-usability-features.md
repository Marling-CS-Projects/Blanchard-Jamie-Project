# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                        | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a fair gameplay environment for the user    | Success      |
| 2           | Make the AI challenging enough for players to beat | Success      |

### Feature 1 (Mostly Met)

A fair gameplay environment is more fun because users understand what is happening and feel like everything happening should happen. Users reported the controls were mostly easy to use with little input lag, error tolerance and balance between different players and characters. The only unfair aspect would be that player 2's controls take longer to get used to than player 1's.

### Feature 2 (Mostly Met)

Most users reported that the AI was a medium difficulty. This means the AI is hard enough to provide a challenge without being too difficult, even if the AI sometimes falls off the stage or stops attacking.

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                                    | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a main menu that allows you to easily navigate the game | Success      |

### Feature 1 (Mostly Met)

Making an easy main menu to navigate allows players to easily start gameplay. The main menu is easy to navigate with a keyboard. However, I wish I added the ability to control it with mouse controls as well as a keyboard as this means users don't have to learn menu keybinds while providing the option for both players to control it at the same time.

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Multiplayer | Success      |
| 2           | Game art    | Success      |

### Feature 1 (Mostly Met)

Multiplayer allows players to compete against other players, adding a social element. The game allows for multiplayer as a primary feature, which is good as 5/9 of players said they preferred multiplayer. However, you can only play multiplayer locally, so there's no online multiplayer.

### Feature 2 (Mostly Met)

The art is very important because it determines how the player sees the events of the game. The art I ended up using was unique as it was designed by multiple artists, including myself and my friends. This allowed anyone who wanted to design a character to be a part of the game

Despite this, I received requests in my form to improve the graphics or add animations. While the framework supports animations now, I didn't have enough time to design them. I could also improve the graphics by using the old DrawRect function for the stage and moves and using the colour function I added for moves.

## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description            | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | The game doesn't crash | Success      |
| 2           | There are no bugs      | Success      |

### Feature 1 (Met)

The game crashing would interrupt the gameplay loop, ruining the experience for users (especially as progress isn't saved when the game closes). No users reported that the game crashed, despite running it on different types of machines it wasn't tested on.

### Feature 2 (Mostly Met)

There being few bugs means the player's experience isn't interrupted by unintended events. There was only 1 bug reported.\
"In the pause screen, not all controls were displayed, only 4 of them"\
This only happens if the game is in fullscreen mode and can be fixed if I rework the fullscreen mode.

However, I found some bugs while playing the game myself.

* If you're not tabbed on the window and perform keyboard inputs, the game will still register the inputs.
* If you have 5 projectiles out at one point and try to use a move, it won't activate.&#x20;
* If you lure the AI to the edge of the stage and get it to use a special move, it will fall off the stage.
* If Troll Face uses their side special near the edge of the stage on top of the opponent, they will land a hit (which isn't meant to happen) and then keep using the move until they fall off the stage.

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                      | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | The game should be easy to learn | Success      |

### Feature 1 (Met)

The game being easy to learn means the player can quickly start gameplay. Despite little help being given to the player, the objective is intuitive enough that players can easily work out the objective of the game. 3/4 of the players found the controls easy to use, which, bearing in mind that I had to fit 18 controls on one keyboard, met expectations.

In addition to this, any comments about improving controls referenced making them more "intuitive" or "natural" but no one could work out a better setup.
