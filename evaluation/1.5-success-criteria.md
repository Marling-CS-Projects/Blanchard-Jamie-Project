### Criterion 1 (Partially Met)

The stage has had collisions since cycle 2, but it's been hard to stop players from passing through it if they collide with the corners. I attempted to fix the collision in cycles 3, 5 and 8 as you could use the advanced movement options like double jumps and dashes to clip through. However, it's harder to tell that the stage is a solid platform after cycle 11 due to the changes in how it's displayed due to the DrawRect function. It does, however, look more natural.

### Criterion 2 (Met)

Cycle 6 allowed me to initialise stats when the game started. Still, as player 1 initialised at gfx.screenWidth \* 3 / 4  and player 2 initialised at gfx.screenWidth / 4, player 1's midpoint was gfx.screenWidth \* 3 / 4 + width / 2 and player 2's midpoint was gfx.screenWidth / 4 + width / 2, it meant player 2 spawned closer to the centre of the stage. In Cycle 7, I made player 1 spawn at gfx.ScreenWidth / 4 + 100 and player 2 spawn at gfx.ScreenWidth / 4 \* 3 - Player2.width - 100, which made them spawn the same distance from the centre.

### Criterion 3-6 (Mostly Met)

Moves and lives were made in cycle 4, but storing their values in cycle 7 proved tough as I had to pass a value from game.cpp to character.cpp and then to move.cpp. I eventually initialised a vector in game.h with each character's stats and moves being stored in a parameter. However, using a vector restricted my parameters as I had to pass 310 parameters from Game to Character, which made the code unsustainable and difficult to edit. While comments helped with this, it was still difficult.

{% code title="Character.cpp" %}
```cpp
width = (int)parameters[0];
height = (int)parameters[1];
walkSpeed = parameters[2];
...
downSpecialR = parameters[308];
downSpecialG = parameters[309];
downSpecialB = parameters[310];
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Game.h" %}
```cpp
89, //parameters[0]Width
102, //parameters[1]Height
3, //parameters[2]WalkSpeed
...
255, //parameters[308]Down Special R
180, //parameters[309]Down Special G
130 //parameters[310]Down Special B  
```
{% endcode %}

### Criterion 7 & 8 (Mostly Met)

I implemented invincibility in cycle 7. If a player hits an opponent with invincibility, they would be in the normal end lag for the move but the opponent would be unaffected. After that, I added an invincible dodge and a cooldown for it. However, I wanted to make characters' dodge last for different lengths as well as the cooldowns without adding a new character stat. I decided that every character would have 20 frames of invincibility while dodging, but the frames they would be in end lag for would be 30 \* weight and the cooldown before you could use it again would be 120 \* weight. However, even after this, characters like Rock have a much higher dodge than intended because their fall speed is high and one of the calculations for dodge is vy = -fallSpeed.&#x20;

### Criterion 9 & 10 (Met)

I implemented these with the main menu in cycle 6, but I initially didn't reset all values when the game ended. I need to clear all moves, coordinates, the timer and other character stats like invincibility. This was hard to manage in earlier cycles as I had 2 different functions that both needed to reset all character stats. This was simplified when I made GameEnd()

### Criterion 11-21 (Mostly Met)

I've explained my reasoning for these specific controls in the [features](../analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#player-inputs), but I struggled to implement a few. Dodging with player 1 uses left shift, but if I used VK\_SHIFT (0x10) then it could be triggered with right shift (which means player 2 can accidentally press player 1's dodge button). This meant I had to use VK\_LSHIFT (x0A0). In addition to that, on one keyboard the game was tested on, VK\_OEM\_1(0xBA) or ";" didn't register, so player 2 couldn't use special moves. I also decided to modify the left and right inputs to allow players to easily change direction, such that if they're holding left and press right, they will immediately start moving right and the other way around.

{% code title="Character.cpp" %}
```cpp
if (rightPriority) {
	rightPriority = right && left;
}
else if (left && right && !rightHeld) {
	rightPriority = true;
}
if (left && !rightPriority) { //If you're holding left
	vx -= acceleration; //Increase left velocity
	if (vx < -speed) { //If you're over terminal velocity
		vx = -speed; //Go to terminal velocity
	}
	if (onStage) {
		facingRight = false;
	}
}
else if (right) { //If you're holding right
	vx += acceleration; //Increase right velocity
	if (vx > speed) { //If you're over terminal velocity
		vx = speed; //Go to terminal velocity
	}
	if (onStage) {
		facingRight = true;
	}
}
...
rightHeld = right;
```
{% endcode %}

### Criterion 22 (Met)

The only issue here was on early builds, if you jump and start moving into the stage, the game will think you're on the stage so give you your double jumps back and jump (if jump is still held). This was fixed by only classifying the player as on stage if vy>=0

### Criterion 23-31 (Met)

There weren't many problems with the basic move parameters, but I had to:

Implement fixed and scalar knockback\
Not make players lag during the active duration of the move if it's a projectile (so the projectile can move and the player can move after the end lag)\
Make moves face the same direction as the player

```
if (!isFacingRight) { //If facing left
	additionalX = additionalX * -1 + playerWidthReferral - width; //Flip the additional value left
	fixedX *= -1; //Flip the fixed horizontal knockback
	scalarX *= -1; //Fix the scalar horizontal knockback
	vx *= -1; //Flip thehorizontal movement
	accelerationx *= -1; //Flip the horizontal acceleration
}
```

### Criterion 32 (Partially met)

The stage's aesthetics changed in Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 4 and Cycle 11/12.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Cycle 1" %}
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Cycle 2" %}
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Cycle 4" %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Cycle 11/12" %}
<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}



Even if I prefer the look of Cycle 4's to Cycle 12, users still said the stage was easy to see. The red stage in comparison to the black background provided a good contrast, but the stage being 1 pixel thick was a disadvantage.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Criterion 33 (Met)

Since the designs are simple and the hitbox can be seen in the pause menu or while dodging, the players should be able to tell where the hitboxes are

### Criterion 34 (Mostly Met)

As moves are displayed in the same way as the stage and the stage is easy to see, moves are easy to see. However, it suffers the same issue as the stage where it could be better with the old DrawRect function.

### Criterion 35-37 (Mostly Met)

As I don't trust my AI to not reach a stalemate if it goes against another AI, I've only allowed the second player to be replaced with an AI. Apart from that, the start menu works well (but you have to use keyboard controls which means the players have to learn new keybinds).

### Criterion 38 (Met)

The HUD shows the exact percent of both players at all times by calling an array of numbers for each number in the player's percent.

{% code title="Game.cpp" %}
```cpp
numbers[((int)Player1.playerPercentage - (int)Player1.playerPercentage % 10) / 10]->Draw(1920 / 4, 900, false); //Player 1 percent
numbers[(int)Player1.playerPercentage % 10]->Draw(1920 / 4 + 30, 900, false); //Player 1 percent
gfx->DrawRectFill(1920 / 4 + 64, 939, 1920 / 4 + 66, 941, 255, 255, 255, 1); //Decimal point
numbers[(int)(Player1.playerPercentage * 10) % 10]->Draw(1920 / 4 + 70, 900, false); //Player 1 percent
```
{% endcode %}

<table><thead><tr><th width="78">Ref. No.</th><th width="410">Criterion</th><th>When it was developed</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>39</td><td>Characters should have unique moves and stats</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/2.2.8-cycle-8.md">Cycle 8</a></td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>There should be music and sounds on hit</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/2.2.9-cycle-9.md">Cycle 9</a></td></tr><tr><td>41</td><td>There will be a buffer system</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/2.2.2-cycle-2.md">Cycle 2</a></td></tr><tr><td>42</td><td>The AI should be challenging enough to beat</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/2.2.10-cycle-10.md">Cycle 10</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Criterion 39 (Met)

Cycle 8 made every character unique, but to allow players to select every character and have fun I had to change the stats on most cycles after that to make certain characters better or worse. Even after my own changes, I still received balancing suggestions

* "The faster characters (especially the Octagon guy) were really hard to play against as they just combo so many times you feel like you're just watching the game happen rather than playing it. The pink bird was also difficult to play as a character with that large of a hitbox didn't have any large attacks."&#x20;
* "Tiny dog dude demolished the rock guy"
* "Dog was very powerful "
* "Nerf Trollface"
* "The chicken had too many jumps"

This shows me that people think the faster characters are more powerful, so I can either nerf their damage and stun or buff the slower characters. The responses at least give me an idea of who is more powerful.&#x20;

During my testing, I noticed you could combo circle's down air into itself, eventually into a forward air to take a life away from the opponent after hitting them at 0%.

On top of this, I found it was hard to take an opponent's life with the damage being capped at 99% (unlike similar games like Smash Bros. Ultimate and Rivals of Aether) so I should have decreased the weight stat of all characters by 0.1 or more.

### Criterion 40 (Mostly Met)

When I introduced sounds I added music to the start menu, credits and battle. I also introduced a sound effect that changed pitch (before cycle 11) / speed (in cycle 12) depending on how much damage the hit dealt. However, as the hit sound doesn't start playing immediately, there can be a large delay when a big (slow) hit plays.

### Criterion 41 (Met)

Due to the way I introduced inputs, you could input an action and it will perform the action (provided you're still inputting it) as soon as it can. However, there is an order of operations as if left and right are pressed at the same time, you will move right and if multiple attack inputs are held, it will first check if special is held, then light, then heavy, then dodge.&#x20;

### Criterion 42 (Mostly Met)

The AI provided a good challenge for players, as most rated it 3/5 difficulty (where 1 is easy and 5 is hard). However, occasionally the AI would fail to recover and the AI can't tell where moves are so will often run into moves.
