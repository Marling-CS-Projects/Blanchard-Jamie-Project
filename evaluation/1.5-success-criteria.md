### Criterion 1

The stage has been interactable since cycle 2 but I had to keep fixing the collision.

### Criterion 2

The players have been initialised with different starting stats since cycle 3

### Criterion 3-6

Moves and lives were made in cycle 4

### Criterion 7 & 8

Invincibility has worked since cycle 7

### Criterion 9

Lives were implemented in cycle 6

### Criterion 10

The game timer was made in cycle 9

### Criterion 11-13

Basic movement was added in cycle 2

### Criterion 14-16

Moves have been input able since they were implemented in cycle 4

### Criterion 17

Dodging was made at the same time as invincibility in cycle 7

### Criterion 18

The pause menu was made at the same time as the start menu, in cycle 6

### Criterion 19

Different directions of moves have been input able since cycle 4 but were only implemented in cycle 8

### Criterion 20 & 21

This is just more basic movement I did in cycle 2

### Criterion 22

This was more movement from cycle 2

### Criterion 23-31

All of these were implemented at the same time as moves, even if they were only properly utilised in cycle 8
