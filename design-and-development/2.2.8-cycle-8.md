# 2.2.8 Cycle 8

## Design

### Objectives

I plan to add individual move sets for my characters to make them more unique. While doing this I'll patch out any glitches I encounter. During this process I'll play the game with friends to see which characters are too powerful or weak and try to fix this. I'll be continuing that through the rest of my development.

* [x] Make a unique move set for Circle
* [x] Make a unique move set for A
* [ ] Make a unique move set for Lightning
* [ ] Make a unique move set for Dog
* [ ] Make a unique move set for Chicken
* [ ] Make a unique move set for Rock
* [ ] Make a unique move set for Troll
* [ ] Make a unique move set for Big B
* [x] Make it so that moves that the player is attached to don't clip into the stage
* [ ] Note to self, add the starting cooldown back

## Development

### Outcome



### Challenges

While testing new moves, I found that the stun values weren't working correctly. After some debugging I found the player hitting the move had the correct end lag but the player that was hit had more stun than I expected. Eventually I found the code for MoveThatHitStun

{% code title="Character.cpp" %}
```cpp
int Character::MoveThatHitStun()
{
	return 50;
	//return moveArray[moveThatHit].stunDuration;
}
```
{% endcode %}

I was at this point finished developing 4 characters with every move having 50 frames of stun

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    |              |               |                       | Pass      |
