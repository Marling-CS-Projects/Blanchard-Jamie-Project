# 2.2.8 Cycle 8 - Individualising Characters

I plan to add individual move sets for my characters to make them more unique. While doing this I'll patch out any glitches I encounter. During this process I'll play the game with friends to see which characters are too powerful or weak and try to fix this. I'll be continuing that through the rest of my development.

* [x] Make a unique move set for Circle
* [x] Make a unique move set for A
* [x] Make a unique move set for Lightning
* [x] Make a unique move set for Dog
* [x] Make a unique move set for Chicken
* [x] Make a unique move set for Rock
* [x] Make a unique move set for Troll
* [x] Make a unique move set for Big B
* [x] Make it so that moves that the player is attached to don't clip into the stage

## Development

### Outcome

After making the characters, I started to see some clear archetypes\
Circle is a fast offense character based around hitting the development moves to kill\
a is an aerial character based around conditioning the opponent with down air and down special to get in and land some brutal low range hits\
Sigma Monkey Of Doom is a burst damage character focussed around using dodge to approach\
Dog is a slow small character that uses its small hitbox to approach opponents\
Chicken is a zoner based around using its projectiles to stop opponents from approaching\
Rock is a heavyweight based around landing slow, brutal hits\
Troll is a rushdown character based around comboing its small hitboxes together to rack up damage and kill with forward air\
Big B is a slow heavyweight with powerful options

### Challenges

While testing new moves, I found that the stun values weren't working correctly. After some debugging I found the player hitting the move had the correct end lag but the player that was hit had more stun than I expected. Eventually I found the code for MoveThatHitStun

{% code title="Character.cpp" %}
```cpp
int Character::MoveThatHitStun()
{
	return 50;
	//return moveArray[moveThatHit].stunDuration;
}
```
{% endcode %}

I was at this point finished developing 4 characters with every move having 50 frames of stun

## Testing

For testing this cycle I got people to test the characters and give me feedback on the balance. My notes were as follows

Character playtesting notes:\
Circle struggles to hit Dog (Only has 3 moves that can hit) \
a seems balanced \
Monkey lack of kill moves \
Easy to fall off the map (buff dodge) \
Lack of kill move for Dog \
Rock feels pretty balanced \
Troll needs a movement buff \
Big B seemed pretty balanced
