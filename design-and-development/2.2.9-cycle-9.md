# 2.2.9 Cycle 9

## Design

### Objectives

Add sound so that I can tell how much the program is lagging and then try to fix the menu

* [x] Add a hit sound
* [x] Add a main menu theme
* [x] Add multiple battle themes that are randomly selected
* [ ] Change the main menu layout

### Usability Features

*

### Key Variables

| Variable name | Use |
| ------------- | --- |
|               |     |
|               |     |
|               |     |

### Pseudocode

```
// Some code
```

## Development

### Outcome

For hit sounds I used the hit file that came with the framework

For the main menu theme I ended up using [Terrible song In 100 bpm](https://freemusicarchive.org/music/lundstroem/songs-i-regard-terrible/terrible-song-in-100-bpm/)

### Challenges

I tried to have a go at changing the backgrounds again but that heavily lagged the program, even if most of the background was transparent, so I'm definitely stuck with the black background. Proof of this is found [here](https://github.com/17b23802/Blanchard-Jamie-Project-Result/releases/tag/Cycle9MapSelection)

## Testing
