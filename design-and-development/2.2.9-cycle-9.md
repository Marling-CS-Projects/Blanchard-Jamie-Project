# 2.2.9 Cycle 9 - Sound

## Design

### Objectives

Add sound so that I can tell how much the program is lagging and then try to fix the menu

* [x] Add a hit sound
* [x] Add a main menu theme
* [x] Add multiple battle themes
* [ ] ~~Have each battle theme be linked to a specific background~~
* [x] Have the battle themes be randomly selected
* [x] Add credits
* [x] Rework the main menu
* [x] Improve the usability of my code
* [x] Add a hotkey to go back to the main menu during a game

### Key Variables

| Variable name | Use                                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| xCoordinates  | Stores the X coordinates that the move can hit the opposing player on |
| yCoordinates  | Stores the Y coordinates that the move can hit the opposing player on |

## Development

### Outcome

For hit sounds, I used the hit file that came with the framework

For the main menu theme, I ended up using [Terrible song In 100 bpm](https://freemusicarchive.org/music/lundstroem/songs-i-regard-terrible/terrible-song-in-100-bpm/)

Battle theme 3 [https://freemusicarchive.org/music/beat-mekanik/single/all-star/](https://freemusicarchive.org/music/beat-mekanik/single/all-star/)

Battle theme 4 [https://freemusicarchive.org/music/kathrin-klimek/cinema-masterful-film-music-vol-1/the-march-of-the-dragon-hunters/](https://freemusicarchive.org/music/kathrin-klimek/cinema-masterful-film-music-vol-1/the-march-of-the-dragon-hunters/)

To help myself work on the main menu, instead of using multiple sprites I used one 1920\*1080 sprite so it was easier to position everything relative to each other. I can't do this with the stage as doing this lags the game, but lag doesn't matter in the main menu as there are no animations and the music isn't affected. I did the same thing with the credits and pause menu.

To improve the usability of my code I put code blocks I used multiple times into functions (such as stage collision), adding comments and optimising my move collision code by not checking every pixel of the opponent

{% code title="Move.h" %}
```cpp
int xCoordinates[4];
int yCoordinates[4];
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Move.cpp Activate()" %}
```cpp
xCoordinates[0] = 0;
xCoordinates[1] = width; //Sets the maximum possible coordinate to every value that can obtain it
xCoordinates[2] = width; //Sets the maximum possible coordinate to every value that can obtain it
xCoordinates[3] = width; //Sets the maximum possible coordinate to every value that can obtain it
for (int i = 1; i * player2WidthReferral < width; i++) { //For every coordinate that fits inside the player's width
	xCoordinates[i] = i * player2WidthReferral; //Add that coordinate to an array
}
yCoordinates[0] = 0;
yCoordinates[1] = height; //Sets the maximum possible coordinate to every value that can obtain it
yCoordinates[2] = height; //Sets the maximum possible coordinate to every value that can obtain it
yCoordinates[3] = height; //Sets the maximum possible coordinate to every value that can obtain it
for (int i = 1; i * player2HeightReferral < height; i++) { //For every coordinate that fits inside the player's height
	yCoordinates[i] = i * player2HeightReferral; //Add that coordinate to an array
}
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Move.cpp IsMoveColliding" %}
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
	for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
		if (x + additionalX + xCoordinates[i] >= Player2x && //If the X coordinate is greater than the player's
			x + additionalX + xCoordinates[i] <= Player2x + Player2width && //If the x coordinate is less than the player's plus their width
			y + additionalY + yCoordinates[j] >= Player2y && //If the Y coordniate is greater than the player's
			y + additionalY + yCoordinates[j] <= Player2y + Player2height //If the y coordinate is les than the player's plus their height
		) { //If inside the player's coordinates
			hasHit = true; //Stop the fucntion from running again
			if (disappearOnHit) {
				activeDuration = 1;
				activeDuration = 1; //Disable
			}
			return true; //The move has hit
	}
}
```
{% endcode %}

I set ctrl+enter or ctrl+esc to go back to the main menu if the game is paused.

### Challenges

I tried to change the backgrounds again, but that heavily lagged the program, even if most of the background was transparent, so I'm stuck with the black background. Proof of this is found [here](https://github.com/17b23802/Blanchard-Jamie-Project-Result/releases/tag/Cycle9MapSelection)

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                                       | What I expect                                               | What actually happens                           | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Test all music (main menu, credits and battle)                     | All music to play as expected                               | As expected                                     | Pass      |
| 2    | Test hit sounds                                                    | The sound to change based on the damage dealt               | As expected                                     |           |
| 3    | Ensure all menus display correctly                                 | All menus should appear like the bitmap file provided       | The pause menu overlaps with the player percent |           |
| 4    | Ensure the game correctly resets when abruptly ended by ctrl+enter | When the game restarts, it should be like the first restart | As expected                                     |           |
