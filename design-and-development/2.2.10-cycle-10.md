# 2.2.10 Cycle 10

## Design

### Objectives

Add the ability for one player to play the game by letting the second player be controlled by an AI. I did this by giving a new class information about the game state, it then uses that information to decide which inputs to use and then inputting them into the normal input handler for player 2.&#x20;

* [ ] Allow the AI to be toggled on and off
* [ ] Add a visual indicator that the AI is enabled
* [ ] Add a restart hotkey and an exit game hotkey
* [ ] Allow the AI's inputs to be used as player inputs
* [ ] Initialise a random variable for the AI
* [ ] Make a recovery function to allow the AI to get back to the stage
* [ ] Make a function to determine if the AI should use a move
* [ ] Make a function to allow the AI to move towards the player
* [ ] Allow projectiles to still move and collide while the game is in stun
