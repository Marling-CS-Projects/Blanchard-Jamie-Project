# 2.2.11 Cycle 11 - GDI+

## Design

### Objectives

I realised the main issues I wanted to fix with my code were all problems with the Chill Framework. The Chilli Framework was laggy, the window couldn't be resized (so I made it only work with 1080P screens), you couldn't close it using Alt+f4 and the frame rate scaled with the screen, so the game ran twice as fast on a 60 fps screen than it did on a 30 fps screen. I already had to modify the framework to allow transparent sprites and sprite flipping anyway, so I thought the easiest way to fix those issues would be to write my own framework.\
\
This would give me more control over the project as I knew what was going on in the entire project and could easily modify it. After some research, I found [GDI+](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/gdiplus/-gdiplus-loading-and-displaying-bitmaps-use) which is a C++ API that allows me to draw images and text on a C++ window.&#x20;

* [x] Create a window from a blank project
* [x] Import GDI+
* [x] Create a frames-per-second limiter
* [x] Allow images to be drawn
* [x] Allow images to be flipped
* [x] Allow rectangles to be drawn
* [x] Allow text to be drawn
* [x] Add Sounds

### Outcome

I could follow the [Microsoft tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/gdiplus/-gdiplus-drawing-a-line-use) to create a window and initialise GDI+. I had a lot of modifications to make though, as this code only draws one image. I started by adding a frames-per-second limiter to ensure the game ran at a constant speed

{% code title="GDIPLUS.cpp" %}
```cpp
#include <chrono>

//Setup timer
typedef std::chrono::high_resolution_clock hiresclock;

while (true)
{
    //Handles client messages
    if (PeekMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE))
    {
        if (msg.message == WM_QUIT)
            break;
        TranslateMessage(&msg);
        DispatchMessage(&msg);
    }

    //Handles clock
    static auto timer = hiresclock::now();
    auto milisec = (hiresclock::now() - timer).count() / 1000000;

    if (milisec > 16.666666667)
    {
        //Main code
        //...
        //Manages timer
        timer = hiresclock::now();
    }
}
```
{% endcode %}

After that I added my previous files and initialised a PaintStruct and the main loop

```cpp
PAINTSTRUCT ps;
HDC hdc = BeginPaint(hWnd, &ps);
Game game(hdc);
```

I passed hdc into game (which wasn't there before) so that I could use it to initialise Graphics.&#x20;

{% code title="CustomGraphics.cpp" %}
```cpp
CustomGraphics::CustomGraphics(HDC& hdc)
    :
    graphics(hdc),
    brush(Color(255, 0, 0, 255)),
    fontFamily(L"Times New Roman")
{
}
```
{% endcode %}

I could use my new Graphics to draw Images

```cpp
void CustomGraphics::DrawSprite(float x, float y, Image& image)
{
    graphics.DrawImage(&image, x, y);
}
```

But after trying to draw a sprite I found that after using EndPaint() (to draw the next frame), the next frame was drawn under the first one. This meant it couldn't be seen by the player. To fix this I had to change my loop to never end a paint, and clear the image before drawing again.&#x20;

The last thing I had to do for sprites was implement the transparency effect but as I couldn't edit the code that drew the sprites I had to find a way to implement it that didn't exclude a specific colour. I found that if you make an image transparent in the normal way through a paint application it doesn't display anything on the transparent pixels. This didn't work for the Chilli framework as any transparent pixels drew a black pixel.

This finally gave me sprites, but I then couldn't scale them or flip them. GDI has no built-in scaling, meaning I had to scale myself. To do this, I passed the client's dimensions from GDIPLUS.cpp to Game.cpp to CustomGraphics.cpp at the start of every frame so I could use them to scale the images relative to the 1920\*1080 I drew the original game at. I then needed to add the ability to flip sprites, which was much easier to do than in the Chilli Framework.

```cpp
void CustomGraphics::DrawSprite(float x, float y, Image& image, bool flip)
{
    if(flip){
        Point destinationPoints[] = {
            Point(clientX / 1920 * (x + image.GetWidth()), clientY / 1080 * (y)), //Upper left
            Point(clientX / 1920 * (x), clientY / 1080 * (y)), //Upper right
            Point(clientX / 1920 * (x + image.GetWidth()), clientY / 1080 * (y + image.GetHeight())) //Lower left
        };
        graphics.DrawImage(&image, destinationPoints, 3);
    }
    else {
        Point destinationPoints[] = {
            Point(clientX / 1920 * (x), clientY / 1080 * (y)), //Upper left
            Point(clientX / 1920 * (x + image.GetWidth()), clientY / 1080 * (y)), //Upper right
            Point(clientX / 1920 * (x), clientY / 1080 * (y + image.GetHeight())) //Lower left
        };
        graphics.DrawImage(&image, destinationPoints, 3);
    }
}
```

After that, I added DrawRect and DrawText to finish my graphics class. I finished things off by changing the images to be defined using the new system

{% code title="game.h" %}
```cpp
Image imagename;
```
{% endcode %}

```cpp
Game::Game(HDC& hdc)
	:
	imagename(L"filename.bmp"),
{
	...
}

gfx.DrawSprite(x, y, aiWarning, flip);
```

The last thing I needed to do was add sound, so I used PlaySound(L"filename.wav", NULL, SND\_ASYNC | SND\_FILENAME) to run sound files.

### Challenges

After porting all the images, I started to have lag issues, where every frame, the game would take so long to render an image that the screen would flash white after clearing it, making a bad visual experience for the user. I tried to fix this by using DrawText instead of images for images such as the main menu.

{% code title="Game.cpp" %}
```cpp
//Player 1 controls
gfx.DrawTextW(134, 524, L"Player 1:");
gfx.DrawTextW(134, 564, L"Move with WASD");
gfx.DrawTextW(134, 604, L"Jump with G");
gfx.DrawTextW(134, 644, L"Light attack with F");
gfx.DrawTextW(134, 684, L"Heavy attack with T");
gfx.DrawTextW(134, 724, L"Special attack with H");
gfx.DrawTextW(134, 764, L"Dodge with left shift");

//Player 2 controls
gfx.DrawTextW(1398, 524, L"Player 2:");
gfx.DrawTextW(1398, 564, L"Move with arrow keys");
gfx.DrawTextW(1398, 604, L"Jump with L");
gfx.DrawTextW(1398, 644, L"Light attack with K");
gfx.DrawTextW(1398, 684, L"Heavy attack with O");
gfx.DrawTextW(1398, 724, L"Special attack with ;");
gfx.DrawTextW(1398, 764, L"Dodge with N");

//Credits
gfx.DrawTextW(490, 880, L"Press space to see the credits");
gfx.DrawTextW(490, 940, L"Press alt+f4 to close the game");

gfx.DrawTextW(134, 644, L"Light attack with F");
gfx.DrawTextW(134, 684, L"Heavy attack with T");
gfx.DrawTextW(134, 724, L"Special attack with H");
gfx.DrawTextW(134, 764, L"Dodge with left shift");

gfx.DrawTextW(600, 90, L"Press Q and E to switch characters");
gfx.DrawTextW(900, 90, L"Press I and P to switch characters");
```
{% endcode %}

I also realised that I messed up the code for limiting frames. By putting the timer before the code I make the timer not include the time taken to render a frame

```cpp
if (milisec > 16.666666667)
    {
        //Manages timer
        timer = hiresclock::now();
        //Main code (This was previously before timer)
        game.go();
    }
```

On top of that, to get PlaySound() working I had to add a custom library Winmm.lib to the project. Lastly, to allow the user to resize the window I had to initialise the code while changing the resolution of the window to the maximum the screen's resolution allows for only on startup and then putting it back to normal

```cpp
//Get the client's dimensinos
RECT rc;
GetClientRect(hWnd, &rc);

//Temporarily set the client window to the maximum, this allows the maximum resolution to be used if fullscreened
RECT desktop;
const HWND hDesktop = GetDesktopWindow();
// Set the size of the screen to the variable desktop
GetWindowRect(hDesktop, &desktop);
MoveWindow(hWnd, 0, 0, desktop.right, desktop.bottom, false);

//Initialise with the client window at maximum
PAINTSTRUCT ps;
HDC hdc = BeginPaint(hWnd, &ps);
Game game(hdc);

//Return the client window to normal
MoveWindow(hWnd, rc.left, rc.top, rc.right-rc.left, rc.bottom-rc.top, false);
```
