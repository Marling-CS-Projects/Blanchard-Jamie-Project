# 2.2.6 Cycle 6

## Design

### Objectives

In what may seem like a random next stage, I'm going to develop a start menu and character select. This is so that I can initialise variables on starting the match which will allow me to tidy up the code by not using random variables to initialise values, as well as allowing me to test more interactions with different character variables. First I'll tidy up my projectile code to allow the move functionailty to be complete

* [x] Allow moves detached from the player to have a different active duration to the stun of the player
* [x] Allow support for multiple moves at the same time
* [x] Allow an option for moves to disappear on hitting an opponent
* [x] Create a start screen with the ability to display controls
* [x] Add a weight variable for characters
* [ ] Fix death command (Disable moves on death)
* [ ] Add a visual effect to show which player won the previous match
* [ ] Add a countdown before starting the match
* [ ] Allow people to switch characters to at least 4 different characters
* [ ] Initialise the characters on match start with different move stats and character stats
* [ ] Add the ability to pause the game with the same countdown to restart

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

| Variable name | Use |
| ------------- | --- |
|               |     |
|               |     |
|               |     |

### Pseudocode

```
// Some code
```

## Development

### Outcome

I finished the functions that called specific values from game to player to move by adding functionality to return different move values depending on what was called.&#x20;

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    |              |               |                       | Pass      |
