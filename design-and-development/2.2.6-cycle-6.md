# 2.2.6 Cycle 6

## Design

### Objectives

In what may seem like a random next stage, I'm going to develop a start menu and character select. This is so that I can initialise variables on starting the match which will allow me to tidy up the code by not using random variables to initialise values, as well as allowing me to test more interactions with different character variables. First I'll tidy up my projectile code to allow the move functionality to be complete.

* [x] Allow moves detached from the player to have a different active duration to the stun of the player
* [x] Allow support for multiple moves at the same time
* [x] Allow an option for moves to disappear on hitting an opponent
* [x] Create a start screen with the ability to display controls
* [x] Add a weight variable for characters
* [x] Fix death command (Disable moves on death)
* [x] Add a visual effect to show which player won the previous match
* [x] Add a countdown before starting the match
* [x] Allow people to switch characters to at least 4 different characters
* [x] Initialise the characters on match start with different character stats
* [x] Initialise the characters on match start with different move stats
* [x] Add the ability to pause the game with the same countdown to restart

### Usability Features

* Colour contrast - For the pause menu making sure the colours contrast others are really important so that the controls stand out and to make the pause elements not appear like objects in the game.

### Key Variables

| Variable name                                    | Use                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Move variables                                   | I'm not adding them all here as there are 220 of them but they're variables initialised in Character.cpp that store the data for all of their moves |
| Player1CharacterID and Player2CharacterID        | The ID of the character that Player 1 is                                                                                                            |
| Previous Winner                                  | Who won the previous match to display on the start screen                                                                                           |
| paused                                           | is the game paused                                                                                                                                  |
| enterOrEscapeHeld, qHeld, eHeld, iHeld and pHeld | If the appropriate key is currently held so actions involving it shouldn't be performed                                                             |
| player1Idle and Player2Idle                      | The sprite that should be used for the idle animations                                                                                              |
| player1Move and Player2Move                      | The sprite that should be used when using a move                                                                                                    |
| Other character's idle and move                  | Other characters have had their idle and move sprites added                                                                                         |

### Pseudocode

```
// Some code
```

## Development

### Outcome

I finished the functions that called specific values from game to player to move by adding functionality to return different move values depending on what was called.&#x20;

### Challenges



## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    |              |               |                       | Pass      |
