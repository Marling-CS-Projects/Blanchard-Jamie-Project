# 2.2.12 Cycle 12

## Design

After last cycle's testing, I found that the sound issue is fixable by importing windowscodecs.lib and using mciSendString(), but the others seemed unfixable. The lag couldn't be fixed as if I only clear the screen every frame with a black background, the FPS goes down to \~40 instead of the 60 I'm looking for. That test was done with the logic of the game commented out.&#x20;
