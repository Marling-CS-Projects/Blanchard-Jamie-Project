# 2.2.12 Cycle 12 - DirectX

## Design

### Objectives

After the last cycle's testing, I found that the sound issue is fixable by importing windowscodecs.lib and using mciSendString(), but the other issues seemed impossible to fix. The lag was permanent as if I only cleared the screen every frame with a black background, the FPS went down to \~40 instead of the 60 I was looking for. That test was done with the logic of the game commented out. The flashing was also permanent as if I only rendered the text the game still flashed. DrawRect couldn't be fixed without making the game lag more and there were other small errors such as Visual Studio throwing an error every time I closed the game, so I had to change frameworks again. After more research, I found that DirectX was a newer alternative to GDI+ so decided to use it. I found out how to from a [YouTube tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKK11Ligqitij8r6hd6tfqqesh3T\_xWJA\&si=0ODR\_FpQVGcQTN7k), but they use Microsoft Learn to find the information. My goals this cycle are the same as the previous cycle, just with a new library.

* [x] Use mciSendString() for sound to allow playback of multiple items
* [x] Allow the ~~pitch~~ sound of hit to be changed using mciSendString()
* [x] Use port all my old code (Including the frame limiter) to a new project
* [x] Create a window from a blank project
* [x] Create a graphics class
* [x] Create a frames-per-second limiter
* [x] Allow images to be drawn
* [x] Allow images to be flipped
* [x] Allow rectangles to be drawn ~~and filled~~
* [ ] ~~Allow text to be drawn~~

### Key Variables

| Variable name | Use                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| hwnd          | The window that is created        |
| bmp           | Stores the bitmap that is created |

### Pseudocode

```
// Some code
```

## Development

### Outcome

I could run sound files using mciSendString() by including windowscodecs.lib

```cpp
mciSendStringA("open \"hit.wav\" type mpegvideo alias hit", NULL, 0, NULL);
mciSendStringA("play hit from 0 repeat", NULL, 0, NULL);
```

I could then change the speed of the playback of hit before playing it

```cpp
mciSendStringA("open \"hit.wav\" type mpegvideo alias hit", NULL, 0, NULL);
mciSendStringA("set hit speed 1000", NULL, 0, NULL); //Where 1000 is 1x speed
mciSendStringA("play hit from 0 repeat", NULL, 0, NULL);
```

After porting all my old code excluding GDIPLUS.cpp and Graphics I could add the DirectX starting code

{% code title="main.cpp" %}
```cpp
int WINAPI wWinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE prevInstance, LPWSTR cmd, int nCmdShow) {
	WNDCLASSEX windowclass;
	ZeroMemory(&windowclass, sizeof(WNDCLASSEX));
	windowclass.cbSize = sizeof(WNDCLASSEX);
	windowclass.hbrBackground = (HBRUSH)COLOR_WINDOW;
	windowclass.hInstance = hInstance;
	windowclass.lpfnWndProc = Wndproc;
	windowclass.lpszClassName = L"MainWindow";
	windowclass.style = CS_HREDRAW | CS_VREDRAW;

	RegisterClassExW(&windowclass);

	HWND hwnd = CreateWindowEx(
		WS_EX_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,
		L"MainWindow", //Class Name
		L"DirectX window", //Window Name
		WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW, //Dw Style
		CW_USEDEFAULT, //x 
		CW_USEDEFAULT,  //y
		CW_USEDEFAULT, //Width
		CW_USEDEFAULT, //Height
		NULL, //Parent
		NULL, //Menu
		hInstance, //hInst
		NULL //Param
	);

	if (!hwnd) { //If the window won't display
		return -1; //Exit the program
	}

	gfx = new Graphics;

	if (!gfx->Init(hwnd)) { //If initialising graphics failed
		delete gfx;
		return -1; //Exit the program
	}

	

	ShowWindow(hwnd, nCmdShow); //Display the window

	MSG msg; //Get messages
	
    	//Setup timer
	typedef std::chrono::high_resolution_clock hiresclock;
	
	while (true)
	{
		//Handles client messages
		if (PeekMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE))
		{
			if (msg.message == WM_QUIT) //<=== **** EDITED **** 
				break;
			TranslateMessage(&msg);
			DispatchMessage(&msg);
		}
		else {		
			//Handles clock
			static auto timer = hiresclock::now();
			auto milisec = (hiresclock::now() - timer).count() / 1000000;

			if (milisec > 16.666666667)
			{
				//Manages timer
				timer = hiresclock::now();
			
			}
			
		}
	}
	delete gfx;

	return 0;
}
```
{% endcode %}

I then made a new Graphics class using DirectX

{% code title="Graphics.cpp" %}
```cpp
bool Graphics::Init(HWND hwndReferral)
{
	hwnd = hwndReferral;
	HRESULT res = D2D1CreateFactory(D2D1_FACTORY_TYPE_SINGLE_THREADED, &factory);
	if (res != S_OK) return false;

	res = factory->CreateHwndRenderTarget(
		D2D1::RenderTargetProperties(),
		D2D1::HwndRenderTargetProperties(hwnd, D2D1::SizeU(1920, 1080)), //Initialised to scale 1920*1080
		&renderTarget
	);

	if (res != S_OK) return false;

	res = renderTarget->CreateSolidColorBrush(D2D1::ColorF(0, 0, 0, 1.0), &brush);

	if (res != S_OK) return false;
	return true;
}
```
{% endcode %}

I added BeginDraw, EndDraw and DrawRect

{% code title="Graphics.cpp" %}
```cpp
void Graphics::BeginDraw()
{
	renderTarget->BeginDraw();
}

void Graphics::EndDraw()
{
	renderTarget->EndDraw();
}
void Graphics::DrawRect(float x0, float y0, float x1, float y1, float r, float g, float b, float a)
{
	brush->SetColor(D2D1::ColorF(r, g, b, a));

	renderTarget->DrawRectangle(D2D1::RectF(x0, y0, x1, y1), brush);
}
```
{% endcode %}

And added it to my game loop

{% code title="Game.cpp" %}
```cpp
void Game::ComposeFrame()
{
	gfx->BeginDraw();
	gfx->ClearScreen(0, 0, 0);
	...
	gfx->EndDraw();
}
```
{% endcode %}

I then had to make a custom sprite creating object which initialises the bitmap based on the passed in filename

{% code title="SpriteSheet.cpp" %}
```cpp
SpriteSheet::SpriteSheet(LPCWSTR filename, Graphics* graphics)
{
	gfx = graphics;
	bmp = NULL;
	HRESULT hr;

	IWICImagingFactory* wicFactory = NULL;
	hr = CoCreateInstance(
		CLSID_WICImagingFactory, //CLS ID of the object we're making
		NULL, //Not part of an aggregate
		CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, //DLL runs in the same proceess
		IID_IWICImagingFactory, //Ref to interface that communicates with the object
		(LPVOID*)&wicFactory //The pointer that'll cointain our factory
	); 

	IWICBitmapDecoder* wicDecoder = NULL;
	hr = wicFactory->CreateDecoderFromFilename(
		filename, //Filename
		NULL, //No preferred vendor
		GENERIC_READ, //Only reading
		WICDecodeMetadataCacheOnLoad, //Cache on load*
		&wicDecoder
	);

	//Read the image
	IWICBitmapFrameDecode* wicFrame = NULL;
	hr = wicDecoder->GetFrame(0, &wicFrame);

	IWICFormatConverter* wicConverter = NULL;
	hr = wicFactory->CreateFormatConverter(&wicConverter);

	hr = wicConverter->Initialize(
		wicFrame, //Frame
		GUID_WICPixelFormat32bppPBGRA, //Pixel Format
		WICBitmapDitherTypeNone, //Irrelevant
		NULL, //No pallete needed
		0.0, //Alpha transparency % irrelevant
		WICBitmapPaletteTypeCustom //Irrlrvant
	);

	gfx->GetRenderTarget()->CreateBitmapFromWicBitmap(
		wicConverter, //Converter
		NULL, //D2D1_BITMAP_PROPERTIES
		&bmp //Destination bitmap
	);

	if (wicFactory) wicFactory->Release();
	if (wicDecoder)wicDecoder->Release();
	if (wicConverter) wicConverter->Release();
	if (wicFrame)wicFrame->Release();
}
```
{% endcode %}

And after that, I added a draw function

{% code title="SpriteSheet.cpp" %}
```cpp
void SpriteSheet::Draw(int x0, int y0, bool flip)
{
	gfx->GetRenderTarget()->DrawBitmap(
		bmp, //Bitmap
		D2D1::RectF(
			x0, //X0
			y0, //Y0
			x0 + bmp->GetSize().width, //X1
			y0 + bmp->GetSize().height), //Y1
		1, //Opacity
		D2D1_BITMAP_INTERPOLATION_MODE::D2D1_BITMAP_INTERPOLATION_MODE_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR,
		D2D1::RectF(0, 0, bmp->GetSize().width, bmp->GetSize().height) //Source rectangle
	);
}
```
{% endcode %}

I however couldn't find an excellent way to draw text, so I went back to the fullscreen images I was using before and it didn't lag this time.

### Challenges

To allow the sound to be changed, I had to find a way for the sound to increase when a low damage hit is applied and increase when a high damage hit is applied. I then had to convert the result to text, combine it with "set hit sound " and pass that into mciSendString()

{% code title="Game.cpp" %}
```cpp
std::string soundString = "set hit speed " + std::to_string(2100 - 100 * (int)Player2.MoveThatHitDamage());
mciSendStringA(soundString.c_str(), NULL, 0, NULL);
```
{% endcode %}

As I had enough freedom with GDI+ to manually resize the window, I decided to use this to add a fullscreen option

{% code title="Graphics.cpp" %}
```cpp
void Graphics::Fullscreen()
{
	if (fullscreen) {
		fullscreen = false;
		MoveWindow(hwnd, clientRect.left, clientRect.top, clientRect.right, clientRect.bottom, false);
	}
	else {
		fullscreen = true;
		GetClientRect(hwnd, &clientRect);
		RECT fullscreenRect = { 0,0,GetSystemMetrics(SM_CXSCREEN), GetSystemMetrics(SM_CXSCREEN) };
		int right = fullscreenRect.right;
		AdjustWindowRectEx(&fullscreenRect, WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW, false, WS_EX_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW);
		MoveWindow(hwnd, fullscreenRect.left, fullscreenRect.top, right, fullscreenRect.bottom, false);
	}
}
```
{% endcode %}

To flip an image, I tried to use [Microsoft's tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wic/-wic-bitmapsources-howto-flipandrotate) but it didn't work, so I made a transformation that applied and unapplied itself if flip is true

{% code title="SpriteSheet.cpp" %}
```cpp
void SpriteSheet::Draw(int x0, int y0, bool flip)
{
	if (flip) {
		D2D1_MATRIX_3X2_F flipTransformation = D2D1::Matrix3x2F(-1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0);
		gfx->GetRenderTarget()->SetTransform(flipTransformation);
		x0 = -(x0 + bmp->GetSize().width);
	}
	gfx->GetRenderTarget()->DrawBitmap(
		bmp, //Bitmap
		D2D1::RectF(
			x0, //X0
			y0, //Y0
			x0 + bmp->GetSize().width, //X1
			y0 + bmp->GetSize().height), //Y1
		1, //Opacity
		D2D1_BITMAP_INTERPOLATION_MODE::D2D1_BITMAP_INTERPOLATION_MODE_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR,
		D2D1::RectF(0, 0, bmp->GetSize().width, bmp->GetSize().height) //Source rectangle
	);
	if (flip) {
		D2D1_MATRIX_3X2_F unflipTransformation = D2D1::Matrix3x2F(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0);
		gfx->GetRenderTarget()->SetTransform(unflipTransformation);
	}
}
```
{% endcode %}
