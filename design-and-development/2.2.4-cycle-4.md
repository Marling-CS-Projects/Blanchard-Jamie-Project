# 2.2.4 Cycle 4

## Design

### Objectives

I plan to add moves that take up a specific space, detect if they collide with players, deal a set amount of knockback and stun. I can do this by making a template for moves and have all moves call it with specific parameters. To do this I have to make a lives system to decide what counts as off the map, and add a hurt animation for when a character is in stun

* [x] Add a lives system
* [x] Allow players to input attack inputs
* [x] Restrict player movement when using a move
* [x] Give players move durations
* [x] Give moves move durations
* [x] Draw the move
* [ ] Add start up frames and ending frames
* [ ] Add player collision
* [ ] Add stun
* [ ] Add damage
* [ ] Add the ability for the rectangle to move with the player
* [ ] Add the ability for the rectangle to move independantly of the player

### Key Variables

| Variable name | Use |
| ------------- | --- |
|               |     |
|               |     |
|               |     |

### Pseudocode

```
// Some code
```

## Development

### Outcome

While testing I found that you could still clip through the bottom corners of the stage so I fixed the stage collision. On top of this I made it so that if you jump while moving into the stage, you don't jump as soon as you become level with the stage.\
I implemented the lives system followed by the ability for the game to detect light, heavy and special inputs
