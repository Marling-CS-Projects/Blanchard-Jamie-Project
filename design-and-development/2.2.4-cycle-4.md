# 2.2.4 Cycle 4

## Design

### Objectives

I plan to add moves that take up a specific space, detect if they collide with players, deal a set amount of knockback and stun. I can do this by making a template for moves and have all moves call it with specific parameters. To do this I have to make a lives system to decide what counts as off the map, and add a hurt animation for when a character is in stun

* [x] Add a lives system
* [x] Allow players to input attack inputs
* [x] Restrict player movement when using a move
* [x] Give players move durations
* [x] Give moves move durations
* [x] Draw the move
* [x] Add start up frames and ending frames
* [x] Add player collision
* [x] Add stun
* [x] Add damage
* [x] Make damage reset on death and game reset
* [x] Add the ability for the rectangle to move with the player
* [x] Add the ability for the rectangle to move independently of the player

### Usability Features

* Colour contrast - I reworked the colours so that I can customise it more, so I need to continue to make the colours contrasting each other

## Development

### Outcome

I implemented the lives system followed by the ability for the game to detect light, heavy and special inputs. I started by allowing the light attack button to create a rectangle that's tied to the player's location. I then gave this rectangle the duration, damage, knockback and hit detection necessary. After passing these variables through both players and game I added the ability for players to get knocked back and take damage from moves. I only added one move for now but it works fine. I also added start up lag and end lag to moves so they weren't risk free. I used a different sprite while players were in lag.

### Challenges

Game.cpp can talk to Player1 and Player2, but not their moves. Player1 can talk to its 5 moves, but not player 2's. The moves can't talk to anything else. This means to detect Player2's location and the move's location you need a function that passes forward Player2's location from game.cpp to Player1, where Player1 then calls a function in Move that passes forwards Player2's location. This function then returns a boolean value for if the move is hitting Player2 to Player1. Player1 then returns the same boolean value to game.cpp. This also means for all values like damage, I had to make a function in Player1 that returns the move's damage value.

I also had to make collision code for moves, which involved passing the alternate player's coordinates (without using isPlayer1) and comparing it to the position of the move

## Testing
