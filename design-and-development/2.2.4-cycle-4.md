# 2.2.4 Cycle 4 - Moves

## Design

### Objectives

I plan to add moves that take up a specific space, detect if they collide with players and deal a set amount of knockback/stun. I can do this by making a template for moves and having all moves call it with specific parameters. To do this I have to make a lives system to decide when a player should lose a life and add a hurt animation for when a character is in stun

* [x] Add a lives system
* [x] Allow players to input attack inputs
* [x] Restrict player movement when using a move
* [x] Give players move durations
* [x] Give moves move durations
* [x] Draw the move
* [x] Add start up frames and ending frames
* [x] Add player collision
* [x] Add stun
* [x] Add damage
* [x] Make damage reset on death and game reset
* [x] Add the ability for the rectangle to move with the player
* [x] Add the ability for the rectangle to move independently of the player

### Usability Features

* Colour contrast - I reworked the colours so that I can customise it more, so I need to continue to make the colours contrasting each other

### Key Variables

| Variable name      | Use                                                                                  |

### Pseudocode

```
if moveDuration > 0 then
    left = false
    right = false
    down = false
    jump = false
    light = false
    heavy = false
    special = false
    moveDuration
    

if light then
	Move1.Activate(x, y, true)
	moveDuration = Move1.StartUp(1) + Move1.Duration(1) + Move1.EndLag(1)
```

```
function Activate(xReferral, yReferral, isAttachedToPlayerReferral)
    x = xReferral
    y = yReferral
    isAttachedToPlayer = isAttachedToPlayerReferral
    startUpDuration = 10
    activeDuration = 30
    stunDuration = 20
    width = 50
    height = 10
    fixedX = 3
    fixedY = -3
    scalarX = 10
    scalarY = -10
    damage = 10
    
function Update
    if startUpDuration > 0 then
		startUpDuration--
	if activeDuration > 0 AND startUpDuration == 0 then
		activeDuration--
		if isAttachedToPlayer then
			if isPlayer1 then
				x = xReferral
				y = yReferral
```

## Development

### Outcome

I implemented the lives system followed by the ability for the game to detect light, heavy and special inputs. I started by allowing the light attack button to create a rectangle that's tied to the player's location. I then gave this rectangle the duration, damage, knockback and hit detection necessary. After passing these variables through both players and game I added the ability for players to get knocked back and take damage from moves. I only added one move for now but it works fine. I also added start up lag and end lag to moves so they weren't risk free. I used a different sprite while players were in lag.

### Challenges

Game.cpp can talk to Player1 and Player2, but not their moves. Player1 can talk to its 5 moves, but not player 2's. The moves can't talk to anything else. This means to detect Player2's location and the move's location you need a function that passes forward Player2's location from game.cpp to Player1, where Player1 then calls a function in Move that passes forwards Player2's location. This function then returns a boolean value for if the move is hitting Player2 to Player1. Player1 then returns the same boolean value to game.cpp. This also means for all values like damage, I had to make a function in Player1 that returns the move's damage value.

I also had to make collision code for moves, which involved passing the alternate player's coordinates (without using isPlayer1) and comparing it to the position of the move

## Testing

I realised I never tested my new stage collision in Cycle 3 so I should test it now. On top of that, I should ensure all the features of moves work correctly so that I can make projectiles using the same code.

On top of this moves should only activate after the start up lag | Only the player experiences the startup lag, the move starts instantly |
