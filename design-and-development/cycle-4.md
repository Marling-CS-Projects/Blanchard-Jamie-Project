# Cycle 4

## Design

### Objectives

I plan to add moves that take up a specific space, detect if they collide with players, deal a set amount of knockback and stun. I can do this by making a template for moves and have all moves call it with specific parameters. To do this I have to make a lives system to decide what counts as off the map, and add a hurt animation for when a character is in stun

* [x] Add a lives system
* [ ] Add the ability to call a rectangle with F or K
* [ ] Give that rectangle a duration
* [ ] Add start up frames and ending frames
* [ ] Add player collision
* [ ] Add stun
* [ ] Add damage
* [ ] Add the ability for the rectangle to move with the player
* [ ] Add the ability for the rectangle to move independantly of the player

### Key Variables

| Variable name | Use |
| ------------- | --- |
|               |     |
|               |     |
|               |     |

### Pseudocode

```
// Some code
```

## Development

### Outcome

While testing I found that you could still clip through the bottom corners of the stage so I fixed the stage collision\
I implemented the lives system followed by the ability for the game to detect light, heavy and special inputs
