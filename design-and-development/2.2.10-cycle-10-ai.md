# 2.2.10 Cycle 10

## Design

### Objectives

Add the ability for one player to play the game by letting the second player be controlled by an AI. I did this by giving a new class information about the game state, it then uses that information to decide which inputs to use and then inputting them into the normal input handler for player 2.&#x20;

* [x] Allow the AI to be toggled on and off
* [x] Add a visual indicator that the AI is enabled
* [x] Add a restart hotkey and an exit game hotkey
* [x] Allow the AI's inputs to be used as player inputs
* [x] Initialise a random variable for the AI
* [x] Pass variables into the AI
* [x] Make a recovery function to allow the AI to get back to the stage
* [x] Make a function to determine if the AI should use a move
* [x] Make a function to allow the AI to move towards the player
* [x] Allow projectiles to still move and collide while the game is in hitstun

### Key Variables

| Variable name | Use                                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| left          | A boolean variable that stores if the AI will input left    |
| right         | A boolean variable that stores if the AI will input right   |
| down          | A boolean variable that stores if the AI will input down    |
| up            | A boolean variable that stores if the AI will input up      |
| jump          | A boolean variable that stores if the AI will input jump    |
| light         | A boolean variable that stores if the AI will input light   |
| heavy         | A boolean variable that stores if the AI will input heavy   |
| special       | A boolean variable that stores if the AI will input special |
| dodge         | A boolean variable that stores if the AI will input dodge   |

## Development

### Outcome

I made an AI icon that appears on the start menu when the AI is enabled (by pressing tab)

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/AI Warning.bmp" alt="" data-size="original">

I made it so that you could press ctrl+r on the pause menu to restart.

In AI.h, I initialised left, right, down, up, jump, light, heavy, special, and dodge as public variables so that Game.cpp could use them as parameters

I repurposed the music randomising code to decide what move the AI should use if it can't decide

After deciding what variables were necessary, I made enough variables public to allow the AI to see player 1's coordinates and dimensions, it's own coordinates and dimensions, if it can dodge, it's vertical speed, if it has a double jump, stage coordinates and it's random variable

I made the AI able to tell its position on stage and use that to determine if it needs to get back on the stage

{% code title="AI.cpp" %}
```cpp
void AI::Recover(int x, int y, int width, int vy, bool canDodge, int doubleJump, int stageX0, int stageY0, int stageX1, int stageY1)
{
	if (y < stageY1) { //If not under the stage
		if (x < stageX0) {
			right = true;
		}
		else{
			left = true;
		}
		if (doubleJump > 0 && vy >= 0) {
			jump = true;
		}
		else if (doubleJump == 0 && vy >= 0 && canDodge) {
			up = true;
			dodge = true;
		}
		else if (y > stageY0 && doubleJump == 0 && vy >= 0) {
			up = true;
			special = true;
		}
	}
	else { //If under the stage
		if (x < stageX0 - width - 50) { //If x is far away from the stage
			right = true; //Go towards it
		}
		else if (x < stageX0 + (stageX1 - stageX0) / 2) { //If under the stage
			left = true; //Get out
		}
		else if (x < stageX1 + 50) { //If under the stage
			right = true; //Get out
		}
		else { //If x is far away from the stage
			left = true; //Go towards it
		}
		if (vy >= 0 && x < stageX0 || x > stageX1) {
			if (doubleJump > 0) {
				jump = true;
			}
			else {
				up = true;
				if (canDodge) {
					dodge = true;
				}
				else {
					special = true;
				}
			}
		}
		else {
			dodge = true;
		}
	}
}
```
{% endcode %}

I made the AI decide on a move based on the opponent's decision and its random variable

{% code title="AI.cpp" %}
```cpp
bool AI::ShouldUseMove(int player2x, int player2y, int player2Width, int player2Height, int x, int y, int width, int height, int doubleJump, float moveType, int stageX0, int stageY0, int stageX1, int stageY1)
{
	if (((x > stageX0 && x < stageX1) || (y < stageY0 && doubleJump > 0)) && x - 50 < player2x + player2Width && x + width + 50 > player2x && y - 50 < player2y + player2Height && y + height + 50 > player2y) {
		if (moveType < 0.1) {
			dodge = true;
		}
		else if (moveType < 2) {
			light = true;
		}
		else if (moveType > 3) {
			heavy = true;
		}
		else if ((int)moveType > 4) {
			special = true;
		}

		if (x - 50 < player2x + width && x > player2x) {
			left = true;
		}
		else if (x + width < player2x && x + width + 50 > player2x) {
			right = true;
		}
		else if (y - 50 < player2y + player2Height && y > player2y + player2Height) {
			up = true;
		}
		else if (y + height < player2y && y + height + 50 > player2y) {
			down = true;
		}
		else if ((int)(moveType * 10) % 10 > 5) {
			up = true;
		}
		else {
			down = true;
		}
		return true;
	}
	return false;

}
```
{% endcode %}

And if it shouldn't use a move it should move towards the player

{% code title="AI.cpp" %}
```cpp
void AI::GeneralMovement(int player2x, int player2y, int x, int y, int vy, int doubleJump, float moveType)
{
	if (x > player2x) {
		left = true;
	}
	else if (x < player2x) {
		right = true;
	}
	if ((int)(moveType * 10) < 3) {
		if (player2y < y && vy >= 0) {
			jump = true;
		}
		if (player2y > y) {
			down = true;
		}
	}
	else if ((int)(moveType * 10) == 3 && vy >= 0) {
		jump = true;
	}
}
```
{% endcode %}

I made a new function that runs for each player while the game is in hit-stun that runs moves.

{% code title="Character.cpp" %}
```cpp
void Character::OnlyProjectiles(int stageX0, int stageY0, int stageX1, int stageY1)
{
	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
		moveArray[i].CheckStatus(x,y,stageX0, stageY0, stageX1, stageY1);
	}
}
```
{% endcode %}

### Challenges

Allowing the AI to have access to the variables it needs required me to make loads of specific variables public, resulting in a tough function call to work with

{% code title="Game.cpp" %}
```cpp
ArtifialFriend.Update(Player1.x, Player1.y, Player1.width, Player1.height, Player2.x, Player2.y, Player2.width, Player2.height, Player2.invincibilityCooldown==0, Player2.vy, Player2.doubleJump, stageX0, stageY0, stageX1, stageY1, aiMoveDist(rng));
```
{% endcode %}

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                          | What I expect                                                    | What actually happens                   | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Ensure projectiles move while the game is in hit-stun | Projectiles to be able to move and hit opponents                 | Projectiles can't hti opponents in stun | Pass      |
| 2    | Get the AI off stage and watch it recover             | It should be able to make it back to the stage of possible       |                                         |           |
| 3    | Let the AI try to move towards and hit the player     | It should be able to attack the player relatively quickly        |                                         |           |
| 4    | Make sure the AI isn't easy                           | The AI to take at least 1 life off the player (me) in most games |                                         |           |

While testing I also learnt that rock's high fall speed gives them a dodge that sends them really high, so I'm going to have to find a way to change that. I also learnt that Rock struggles to kill other heavyweights and the AI struggles to kill heavyweights regardless of the character
