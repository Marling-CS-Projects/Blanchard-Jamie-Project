# 2.2.2 Cycle 2 - Basic Movement

## Design

### Objectives

I plan to add basic movement in the form of moving left and right with momentum, jumping, fast-falling and the ability to interact with the stage, all with multipliers so I can change them based on character properties later

* [x] Allow inputs to be registered
* [x] Add the ability for a character to move left and right
* [x] Add falling
* [x] Add the ability to interact with the stage
* [x] Add jumping
* [x] Add double jumping
* [x] Add fast-falling
* [x] Add a second character with a second set of inputs



### Usability Features

* Colour Contrast - Despite changes in colours, colour contrast is still important

### Pseudocode

```
function UpdateCharacter(left, right, down, jump)
    onStage = IsOnStage
    if !jump then
        jumpKeyHeld=false
    
    if left AND vx>-walkSpeed then
        vx=-acceleration
    if right AND vx<walkSpeed then
        vx=acceleration
    if !left AND !right
        if vx > 0 then
			if vx < acceleration then
				vx = 0
			else 
				vx -= acceleration
		if vx < 0 then
			if vx < -acceleration then
				vx = 0
			else 
				vx += acceleration
    
    if onStage then
        if jump then
            vy = -groundJumpHeight
            jumpKeyHeld=true;
    else
        if down then
            fastFalling = true
        if fastFalling then
            if vy < fallSpeed*2 then
                vy += fallAcceleration*2
        else
            if vy<fallSpeed then
                vy += fallAcceleration
    x += vx
    y += vy
        
```

## Development

### Outcome

There are now 2 characters that can jump and move around. They can jump in the air by using their double jump and move around with directional keys

```cpp
void Character::UpdateCharacter(bool left, bool right, bool down, bool jump) {
	onStage = IsOnStage();
	if (jump == false) {
		jumpKeyHeld = false;
	}

	if (left&&vx>-walkSpeed) {
		vx -= acceleration;
	}
	if (right&&vx<walkSpeed) {
		vx += acceleration;
	}
	if (!left&&!right) {
		if (vx > 0) {
			if (vx < acceleration) {
				vx = 0;
			}
			else {
				vx -= acceleration;
			}
		}
		if (vx < 0) {
			if (vx < -acceleration) {
				vx = 0;
			}
			else {
				vx += acceleration;
			}
		}
	}
	if (onStage) {
		if (jump) {
			vy = -groundJumpHeight;
			jumpKeyHeld = true;
		}
	}
	else if (jump && doubleJump > 0 && jumpKeyHeld == false) {
		fastFalling = false;
		doubleJump-=1;
		vy = -aerialJumpHeight;
	}
	else {
		if (down) {
			fastFalling = true;
		}
		if (fastFalling) {
			if (vy < fallSpeed*2) {
				vy += fallAcceleration*2;
			}
		}
		else {
			if (vy < fallSpeed) {
				vy += fallAcceleration;
			}
		}
	}
	x += vx;
	y += vy;
}

bool Character::IsOnStage()
{
	if (x+width > 500 && x < 1420 && y+height > 800 && y < 980) {
		y = 800-width;
		doubleJump = maxDoubleJump;
		fastFalling = false;
		return true;
	}
	else {
		return false;
	}
}
```

### Challenges

It turns out that using a sprite for the stage and background was very laggy, so I replaced it with a rectangle for the stage and the default background. This means I have to accommodate sprites based on the fact that the background is black.

As there is no lives or respawn system I added a temporary reset system that sets both characters to y=500

If you jump by pressing the jump key and double jump with the jump key, you double jump as soon as you jump. This meant I had to add jumpKeyHeld to ensure you only double jump after you let go of the jump key

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                            | What I expect to happen                                                                                                                                | What actually happens                                                                                                                   |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Press nothing                           | The characters will fall to the stage and then stop falling                                                                                            | What I expected                                                                                                                         |
| 2    | Press the jump and fastfall key         | Fall speed should be doubled when the fastfall key is pressed. This stays until you double jump or touch the ground                                    | What I expected                                                                                                                         |
| 3    | Moving left and right in ground and air | Ground and air speed should be different speeds, while coming to a stop after pressing no keys and increasing in speed slowly until reaching max speed | What I expected, apart from the fact that I forgot to implement ground and aerial speed                                                 |
| 4    | Interacting with the stage              | You should lose fall speed on the stage if you land on it from ontop                                                                                   | If you collide with the stage, even if from the side or below, you're put ontop of the stage. This is an issue from the side or bottom. |
