# 2.2.5 Cycle 5

## Design

### Objectives

In what may seem like a random addition, I'm going to develop the title screen next. This is so that I can initialise variables on the game starting

*

### Usability Features

*
* [x] Add the ability for moves to be disjoined from the player so they don't have to start at the top left of the character
* [x] Add the ability for characters to face left or right so moves can be directed more
* [x] Visually make the characters face left and right
* [x] Stop moves that are attached to a player if they get hit
* [x] Make it so that moves can only hit once



### Key Variables

| Variable name | Use |
| ------------- | --- |
|               |     |
|               |     |
|               |     |

### Pseudocode

```
// Some code
```

## Development

### Outcome

While testing I found that you could still clip through the bottom corners of the stage so I fixed the stage collision. On top of this I made it so that if you jump while moving into the stage, you don't jump as soon as you become level with the stage.

### Challenges

\
Making my own flip function that takes the raw values and flips it based on that in a file that's part of the framework

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    |              |               |                       | Pass      |
