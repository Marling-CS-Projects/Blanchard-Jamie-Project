# 2.2.5 Cycle 5 - Projectiles

## Design

### Objectives

I'm going to develop projectiles that can act independently of the player and fix the damage of moves

* [x] Fix the stage collision
* [x] Add the ability for moves to be disjoined from the player so they don't have to start at the top left of the character
* [x] Add the ability for characters to face left or right so moves can be directed more
* [x] Visually make the characters face left and right
* [x] Stop moves that are attached to a player if they get hit
* [x] Make it so that moves can only hit once

### Key Variables

| Variable name      | Use                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| facingRight        | Boolean value in player to determine if the player should be flipped                                                    |
| hasHit             | If a move has already hit the opponent, so shouldn't hit again, might be replaced with maxTimeUntilHit and timeUntilHit |
| additionalX        | The X coordinates added to a move to centre it                                                                          |
| additionalY        | The Y coordinates added to a move to centre it                                                                          |
| isAttachedToPlayer | If a move follows the player's position or not                                                                          |

### Pseudocode

```
if !hasHit&&activeDuration > 0 AND startUpDuration==0 then
		for i = y+additionalY to y + height+additionalY
			for j = x+additionalX to x + width+additionalX
				if i > Player2y AND i<Player2y + Player2height AND j>Player2x AND j < Player2x + Player2width then
					hasHit = true
					return true
```

## Development

### Outcome

While testing I found that you could still clip through the bottom corners of the stage so I fixed the stage collision. On top of this I made it so that if you jump while moving into the stage, you don't jump as soon as you become level with the stage.

{% code title="Character.cpp UpdateCharacter" %}
```cpp
else if(x + width > stageX0 && x < stageX1 && y >= stageY0 - 2 * fallSpeed && y <= stageY1) { //If clipping from the bottom
    y = stageY1; //Stop clipping
}
```
{% endcode %}

After that, I allowed moves to be disconnected from the player with isAttachedToPlayer and then gave it its own momentum. I then allowed characters to face left or right and the moves to position themselves accordingly. Afterwards, I made it so that getting hit chancels your move, both to add to the helplessness that getting hit creates and to ensure that using a move with high lag doesn't cause you to experience the lag after you're already off the stage. Lastly, I made it so that moves can only hit once as previously they hit once every frame so heavily increased percent on every hit.

### Challenges

&#x20;I had to function my own flip function by passing forward an x coordinate of x + sx + 2 \* ((srcRect.right / 2) - (sx)) instead of x + sx if the sprite needed to be flipped. I had to do this in graphics.h which is part of the actual framework.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                         | What I expect                                                              | What actually happens                                                                                                                | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| 1    | Test stage collision                                 | Characters should be unable to collide with the stage                      | As expected                                                                                                                          | Pass      |
| 2    | Test disjointed moves and                            | Moves should be separate from the player if enabled                        | As expected, but I coincidentally found that if a character is facing left and goes past the right boundary of the screen it crashes |           |
| 3    | Test character rotation by checking hitboxes and     | The character sprite should be able to rotate and moves rotating with it   | As expected                                                                                                                          |           |
| 4    | Check how much scalar knockback increases by per hit | If it increases too much, it shows that the move is hitting multiple times | As expected                                                                                                                          |           |
