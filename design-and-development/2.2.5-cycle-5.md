# 2.2.5 Cycle 5

## Design

### Objectives

In what may seem like a random addition, I'm going to develop the title screen next. This is so that I can initialise variables on the game starting

* [x] Fix the stage collision
* [x] Add the ability for moves to be disjoined from the player so they don't have to start at the top left of the character
* [x] Add the ability for characters to face left or right so moves can be directed more
* [x] Visually make the characters face left and right
* [x] Stop moves that are attached to a player if they get hit
* [x] Make it so that moves can only hit once

### Key Variables

| Variable name      | Use                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| facingRight        | Boolean value in player to determine if the player should be flipped                                                    |
| hasHit             | If a move has already hit the opponent, so shouldn't hit again, might be replaced with maxTimeUntilHit and timeUntilHit |
| additionalX        | The X coordinates added to a move to centre it                                                                          |
| additionalY        | The Y coordinates added to a move to centre it                                                                          |
| isAttachedToPlayer | If a move follows the player's position or not                                                                          |

## Development

### Outcome

While testing I found that you could still clip through the bottom corners of the stage so I fixed the stage collision. On top of this I made it so that if you jump while moving into the stage, you don't jump as soon as you become level with the stage.

After that I allowed moves to be disconnected from the player with isAttachedToPlayer and then gave it its own momentum. After that I allowed characters to face left or right and the moves to position themselves accordingly. After that I made it so that getting hit chancels your move, both to add to the helplessness that getting hit creates and to ensure that using a move with high lag doesn't cause you to experience the lag after you're already off the stage. After that I made it so that moves can only hit once as previously they hit once every frame so heavily increased percent on every hit.

### Challenges

&#x20;I had to function my own flip function by passing forward an x coordinate of x + sx + 2 \* ((srcRect.right / 2) - (sx)) instead of x + sx if the sprite needed to be flipped. I had to do this in graphics.h which is part of the actual framework.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect | What actually happens                                                                                              | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| 1    |              |               | I coincidentally found that if a character is facing left and goes past the right boundry of the screen it crashes | Pass      |
