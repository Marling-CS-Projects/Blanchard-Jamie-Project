# 2.2.7 Cycle 7

## Design

### Objectives

I plan to use this cycle to tie up loose ends in my project. I'm going to change my move code to put each move into an array to make them easier to call. After that I want to start by actually implementing the weight variable. After that I'll add the ability to dodge (which as I'm adding invincibility will also allow me to add invincibility on respawn), add a hit sprite on top of move and Idle and I'll also implement the other 2 characters that are in the game files. After doing all that I also want to add a percent display so players can see their own damage.  I also want to add move colour and need to add comments for the previous cycle and this cycle.&#x20;
