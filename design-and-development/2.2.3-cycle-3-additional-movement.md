### Key Variables

| Variable name                              | Use                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| speed                                      | Stat used for calculations involving speed. Changes based on if the character is on the ground or in the air.        |
| acceleration                               | Stat used for calculations involving acceleration. Changes based on if the character is on the ground or in the air. |
| aerialSpeed                                | Horizontal max speed in air                                                                                          |
| walkAcceleration (previously Acceleration) | Horizontal rate of increase of speed on the ground                                                                   |
| aerialAcceleration                         | Horizontal rate of increase of speed in the air                                                                      |
| stageX0                                    | The X coordinate of the left part of the stage                                                                       |
| stageY0                                    | The Y coordinate of the top of the stage                                                                             |
| stageX1                                    | The X coordinate of the right side of the stage                                                                      |
| stageY1                                    | The Y coordinate of the bottom of the stage                                                                          |

### Pseudocode

{% code title="Pseudocode for jumping" %}
```
if onStage
    doubleJump = maxDoubleJump

if not jump
    jumpKeyHeld = false
else if onStage
    vy = -groundJumpHeight
    jumpKeyHeld = true
else if doubleJump > 0 and not jumpKeyHeld
    jumpKeyHeld = true
    fastFalling = false
    doubleJump-=1
    vy = -aerialJumpHeight
```
{% endcode %}

### Outcome

I fixed the stage collision so that characters can't clip into the stage, as well as updating the variables for the stage so that every call to the stage refers to stageX0, stageY0, stage X1 and stageY1 in game.h so that the stage can be easily updated. I also added comments to my code so I can navigate it easier when I want to do more complex operations like changing the stage collision or adding moves

### Challenges

I had to completely rework the IsOnStage function, removing it completely in favour of having an inline if statement that changes some variables, while leaving others until later. Ontop of this I had to add a reset button as I fell off the stage frequently

{% code title="Character.cpp line 4" %}
```cpp
//If on stage
	if (
		x + width >= stageX0 && x <= stageX1 && //If X coordinate is over the stage
		y + height >= stageY0 && y + height <= stageY0 + fallSpeed * 2 //If Y coordinate is level with the stage
		) {
		doubleJump = maxDoubleJump; //Refresh double jumps
		fastFalling = false; //Stop fast falling
		acceleration = walkAcceleration; //Sets acceleration to grounded acceleration
		speed = walkSpeed; //Sets speed to grounded speed
		onStage = true; //Confirm that you're on stage
	}
	else { //If you're not on stage
		acceleration = aerialAcceleration; //Sets acceleration to aerial acceleration
		speed = aerialSpeed; //Sets speed to aerial speed
		onStage = false; //Confirm you're not on stage
	}
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Character.cpp line 92" %}
```
if (onStage) {
		if (vy > 0) { //If falling
			y = stageY0 - width; //Reset y to on stage
		}
	}
	else { //If off stage
		if (y + height >= stageY0  && y <= stageY1 && x + width > stageX0 && x + width <= stageX0 + speed) { //If clipping into stage from the left
			x = stageX0 - width; //Stop clipping
		}
		else if (y + height >= stageY0 && y <= stageY1 && x >= stageX1 - speed && x < stageX1) { //If clipping into stage from right
			x = stageX1; //Stop clipping
		}
		else if (x + width > stageX0 + speed && x + speed < stageX1 - speed && y > stageY1 - fallSpeed * 2 && y < stageY1) { //If clipping into stage from bottom
			y = stageY1; //Stop clipping
		}
	}
```
{% endcode %}

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                            | What I expect                         | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run into stages from sides and below                    | To not clip through the stage         | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Test movement speed when jumping and when on the ground | The movement speeds will be different | As expected           |           |
| 3    | Double jump more than once                              | Should succeed                        | As expected           |           |
