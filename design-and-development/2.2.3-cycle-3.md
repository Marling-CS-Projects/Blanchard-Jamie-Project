# 2.2.3 Cycle 3

## Design

### Objectives

Fix the errors in the testing of Cycle 2

* [ ] Add aerial speed and ground speed
* [x] Fix stage collision

### Key Variables

| Variable name     | Use |
| ----------------- | --- |
| groundedWalkSpeed |     |
| aerialWalkSpeed   |     |

### Pseudocode

{% code title="Charater.cpp IsOnStage()" %}
```
If on stage
    vy=0
    doubleJump = maxDoubleJump
    fastFall = false
else if x is correct and Y is at the bottom of the stage
    y=980
else if y is slightly below and x is running into the stage
    x=500-width or x=1420
```
{% endcode %}

## Development

### Outcome

Fixed the stage collision so that characters can't clip into the stage

### Challenges



## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    |              |               |                       | Pass      |
