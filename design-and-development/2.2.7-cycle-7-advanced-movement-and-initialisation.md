# 2.2.7 Cycle 7 - Advanced Movement and Initialisation

## Design

### Objectives

I plan to use this cycle to tie up loose ends in my project. I'm going to change my move code to put each move into an array to make them easier to call. After that, I want to start by actually implementing the weight variable. After that, I'll add the ability to dodge (which as I'm adding invincibility will also allow me to add invincibility on respawn), add a hit sprite on top of move and Idle. I'll also implement the other 2 characters that are in the game files. After doing that, I also want to add a percent display so players can see their damage.  I also want to add move colour and need to add comments for the previous cycle and this cycle.&#x20;

* [x] Put moves into an array instead of separately
* [x] Implement the other 2 characters
* [x] Implement the weight variable
* [x] Add invincibility
* [x] Add dodging ability
* [x] Draw hit sprites
* [x] Implement hit sprites
* [x] Add percent display
* [x] Add move acceleration
* [x] Add players being able to follow a move (for moves like up special)
* [x] Add free falling for after up special
* [x] Add move colour
* [x] Add comments on the previous cycle
* [x] Make sure I have comments on this cycle

### Key Variables

| Variable name | Use |
| ------------- | --- |
|               |     |
|               |     |
|               |     |

## Development

### Outcome

I moved all the player initialisation variables into game.h in one vector so I could simplify initialisation and moved the sprites into arrays

{% code title="Game.cpp" %}
```cpp
Player1.x = gfx.ScreenWidth / 4 + 100; //Set player 1's starting position
player1Idle = idle[player1CharacterID]; //Set player 1's idle animation
player1Move = move[player1CharacterID]; //Set player 1's move animation
Player1.Initialise(parameters[player1CharacterID]); //Set player 1's variables

Player2.x = gfx.ScreenWidth / 4 * 3 - Player2.width - 100; //Set player 1's starting position
player2Idle = idle[player2CharacterID]; //Set player 1's idle animation
player2Move = move[player2CharacterID]; //Set player 1's move animation
Player2.Initialise(parameters[player2CharacterID]); //Set player 1's variables
```
{% endcode %}

Looking at it after committing the cycle I messed up the comments for player 2. I then initialised parameters in Game.h, with commenting to show which value was tied to which list item

{% code title="Game.h" %}
```cpp
std::vector<std::vector<float>> parameters = {
	{ //CharacterCircle
		100, //parameters[0]Width
		100, //parameters[1]Height
		10, //parameters[2]WalkSpeed
		10, //parameters[3]AerialSpeed
		1, //parameters[4]AerialAcceleration
		1, //parameters[5]WalkAcceleration
		20, //parameters[6]GronudedJumpHeight
		25, //parameters[7]AerialJumpHeight
		1, //parameters[8]FallAcceleration
		10, //parameters[9]FallSpeed
		1, //parameters[10]Weight
		2, //parameters[11]DoubleJumps
...
	},{...},...
	};
```
{% endcode %}

I then implemented this in Character.cpp

{% code title="Character.cpp" %}
```cpp
void Character::Initialise(std::vector<float>& parameters){
	y = 700 - height;
	lives = 3;
	width = (int)parameters[0];
	height = (int)parameters[1];
	walkSpeed = parameters[2];
	aerialSpeed = parameters[3];
	aerialAcceleration = parameters[4];
	walkAcceleration = parameters[5];
	groundJumpHeight = (int)parameters[6];
	aerialJumpHeight = (int)parameters[7];
	fallAcceleration = parameters[8];
	fallSpeed = parameters[9];
	weight = parameters[10];
	maxDoubleJump = parameters[11];
	...
}
```
{% endcode %}

I then added 2 new characters to parameters and allowed for 8 character IDs instead of 6. After all of that, I changed IsHit() to allow for a higher weight value to decrease your knockback and the new invincibility variable to cancel a move hitting

{% code title="Character.cpp" %}
```cpp
void Character::IsHit(int stunReferral, float damageReferral, int fixedXReferral, int fixedYReferral, int scalarXReferral, int scalarYReferral) {
	if (invincibility == 0) {
		stun = stunReferral;
		playerPercentage += damageReferral;
		vx = (fixedXReferral + scalarXReferral * playerPercentage / 100) / weight;
		vy = (fixedYReferral + scalarYReferral * playerPercentage / 100) / weight;
		moveDuration = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
			if (!moveArray[i].isAttachedToPlayer) {
				moveArray[i].PlayerIsHit();
			}
		}
	}
}
```
{% endcode %}

I then added more functionality for invincibility, adding a cooldown so dodge couldn't be spammed, making you gain 5 seconds of invincibility on death and adding a dodge move

{% code title="Character.cpp" %}
```cpp
//If pressing light, heavy or special
else if (dodge && invincibilityCooldown == 0) { //If dodging
	if (left) { //If holding left
		vx = -speed; //Make the character move left
	}
	else if (right) { //
		vx = speed;
	}
	else {
		vx = 0;
	}
	if (!onStage) {
		if (up) {
			vy = -fallSpeed;
		}
		else if (down) {
			vy = fallSpeed;
		}
		else {
			vy = 0;
		}
	}
	invincibility = 20;
	moveDuration = 30 * weight;
	invincibilityCooldown = 120 * weight;
}
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Character.cpp" %}
```cpp
if (invincibility > 0) { //If you have invincibility
	invincibility--; //Reduce the timer
	if (light || heavy || special) { //If you have invincibility and are using a move
		invincibility = 0; //Remove your invincivility
	}
}
else if (invincibilityCooldown>0){ //If the player is unable to dodge
	invincibilityCooldown--; //Reduce the time until the player can dodge again
}
```
{% endcode %}

After drawing some hit sprites, I implemented them in the same way as the other sprites

{% code title="Game.cpp" %}
```cpp
player2Hit = hit[player2CharacterID]; //Set player 1's hit animation
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Game.cpp" %}
```cpp
if (Player2.moveDuration > 0 || Player2.freeFallDuration > 0) { //If Player 2 is using a move
	gfx.DrawSprite(Player2.x, Player2.y, player2Move, SpriteEffect::Copy{}, !Player2.facingRight); //Display move animation
}
else if (Player2.stun > 0) { //If player 2 is in stun
	gfx.DrawSprite(Player2.x, Player2.y, player2Hit, SpriteEffect::Copy{}, !Player1.facingRight); //Display stun animation
}
else {
	gfx.DrawSprite(Player2.x, Player2.y, player2Idle, SpriteEffect::Copy{}, !Player2.facingRight); //Display normal animation
}
```
{% endcode %}

I then made an array that I filled with Surfaces of numbers and called them to display at the bottom of the screen to display the player's percent

{% code title="Game.cpp" %}
```cpp
gfx.DrawSprite(gfx.ScreenWidth / 4 * 3, 900, numbers[((int)Player2.playerPercentage - (int)Player2.playerPercentage % 10) / 10], SpriteEffect::Copy{}, false); //Player 2 percent
gfx.DrawSprite(gfx.ScreenWidth / 4 * 3 + 30, 900, numbers[(int)Player2.playerPercentage % 10], SpriteEffect::Copy{}, false); //Player 2 percent
gfx.PutPixel(gfx.ScreenWidth / 4 * 3 + 65, 940, 255, 255, 255); //Decimal point
gfx.PutPixel(gfx.ScreenWidth / 4 * 3 + 65, 939, 255, 255, 255); //Decimal point
gfx.PutPixel(gfx.ScreenWidth / 4 * 3 + 66, 940, 255, 255, 255); //Decimal point
gfx.PutPixel(gfx.ScreenWidth / 4 * 3 + 66, 939, 255, 255, 255); //Decimal point
gfx.DrawSprite(gfx.ScreenWidth / 4 * 3 + 70, 900, numbers[(int)(Player2.playerPercentage * 10) % 10], SpriteEffect::Copy{}, false); //Player 2 percent
```
{% endcode %}

After changing parameters, Initialise() and Activate() to allow me to pass forward accelerationx, accelerationy, isPlayerAttachedToIt, r, g and b I implemented acceleration

{% code title="Move.cpp" %}
```cpp
void Move::CheckStatus(float xReferral, float yReferral)
{
	if (startUpDuration > 0) { //If not active yet
		startUpDuration--; //Decrease the time until it starts
	}
	else if (activeDuration > 0) { //If move is active
		activeDuration--; //Decrease the time until the move ends
		vx += accelerationx;
		vy += accelerationy;
		x += vx; //Increase the X coordinate
		y += vy; //Increase the Y coordinate
	}
	if (isAttachedToPlayer || startUpDuration > 0) { //If the move is activating or if attached to the player
		x = xReferral + playerWidth / 2; //Set the x coordinate to half way through the player
		y = yReferral; //Set the Y coordinate to the player's
	}
}
```
{% endcode %}

This was followed by isPlayerAttachedToIt

{% code title="Character.cpp" %}
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { //For every move
	moveArray[i].CheckStatus(x,y); //Run the necesarry functions every frame
	if (moveArray[i].isPlayerAttachedToIt && moveArray[i].startUpDuration == 0 && moveArray[i].activeDuration > 0) { //If an active move attaches the player to it
		x = moveArray[i].x; //Update the x coordinate
		y = moveArray[i].y; //Update the y coordinate
		if (!facingRight) {
			x += moveArray[i].width + moveArray[i].additionalX;
		}
		freeFallDuration = 30;
	}
}
```
{% endcode %}

Which was followed by implementing freefall

{% code title="Character.cpp" %}
```cpp
if (moveDuration > 0) { //If using a move
	left = false;
	right = false;
	up = false;
	jump = false;
	light = false;
	heavy = false;
	special = false;
	dodge = false; //Disable all player inputs apart from down
	moveDuration--;
}
else if (freeFallDuration > 0) {
	if (!onStage) {
		freeFallDuration = 30;
	}
	down = false;
	jump = false;
	light = false;
	heavy = false;
	special = false;
	dodge = false;
	freeFallDuration--;
	speed = speed / 2;
	acceleration = acceleration / 4;
}
```
{% endcode %}

Lastly, I added move colour by passing variables the same way I passed move x and y in previous cycles and added comments.

### Challenges

There was so much code to modify to make parameters that I had to use multiple Python scripts to do anything that I couldn't reasonably do myself\

[https://replit.com/@BarryBenson2/Gameh-Adding-parametersx](https://replit.com/@BarryBenson2/Gameh-Adding-parametersx)\
This was only made worse when I had to add acceleration, isPlayerAttachedToIt and move colour
